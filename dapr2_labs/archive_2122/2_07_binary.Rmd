You may well have already heard of these series of experiments, or have seen similar things on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80190510).


`r optbegin("drunkdoor.csv Dataset", olabel=FALSE, show = TRUE, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
**Method**  
Researchers conducted a study in which they approached 120 people, recruited from within the vicinity of a number of establishments with licenses to sell alcohol to be consumed on-premises. Initially, experimenter A approached participants and asked if they were interested in participating in a short study, and obtained their written consent. While experimenter A subsequently talked each participant through a set of questions on multiple pieces of paper (with the pretense of explaining what the participant was required to do), experimenters B and C carrying a door passed between the participant and experimenter A, with experimenter C replacing A (as can be viewed in the video). 

The perceptual load of the experiment was manipulated via a) the presentation of the door and b) the papers held by the experimenters. For 60 of these participants, the door was painted with some detailed graffiti and had a variety of pieces of paper and notices attached to the side facing the participants. Additionally, for these participants, the experimenters handled a disorganised pile of 30 papers, with the top pages covered in drawings around the printed text. For the remaining 60, the door was a standard MDF construction painted a neutral grey, and the experimenters handled only 2 sheets of paper which had minimal printed text on them and nothing else. 

**Measures**   
After experimenters A and C had successfully swapped positions, the participant was asked (now by C) to complete small number of questions taking approximately 1 minute. Either after this set of questions, or if the participant made an indication that they had noticed the swap, the experimenters regrouped and the participant was explicitly asked whether they had noticed the swap.   
Immediately after this, participants were breathalysed, and their blood alcohol content was recorded.  

**Data**  
```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(2834)
N = 120
Xmatrix = tibble(
  int=1,
  bac = runif(N, 0, 0.082),
  age = round(rnorm(N,55,9)),
  condition = rep(0:1,each=N/2)
) 
coefs = c(0, 60, -.3, -5)
mu = as.matrix(Xmatrix) %*% coefs
sigma = 2
y = rnorm(N, mu, sigma)
bind_cols(Xmatrix[,-1], 
          tibble(notice = ifelse(y>mean(y),1,0))
          ) -> df
drunkdoor <- sample_n(df, n())
drunkdoor$id <- paste0("ID",1:N)
drunkdoor <- relocate(drunkdoor, id)
drunkdoor$condition <- factor(ifelse(drunkdoor$condition == 1,"High","Low"))
#write.csv(drunkdoor,"../../data/drunkdoor.csv", row.names=F)
#drunkdoor$condition<-fct_relevel(factor(drunkdoor$condition),"Low")
#changeblind_model <- glm(notice ~ I(bac*100) + condition + age, data = drunkdoor, family = "binomial")
#sjPlot::plot_model(changeblind_model)

```

The data can be downloaded from [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drunkdoor.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drunkdoor.csv).  
A description of the variables included is presented below.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(
variable = names(drunkdoor),
description = c("Unique ID number","Blood Alcohol Content (BAC), A BAC of 0.0 is sober, while in the United States 0.08 is legally intoxicated, and above that is very impaired. BAC levels above 0.40 are potentially fatal.", "Age (in years)","Condition - Perceptual load created by distracting oject (door) and details and amount of papers handled in front of participant (Low vs High)", "Whether or not the participant noticed the swap (Yes = 1 vs No = 0)")
) %>% gt::gt()
```
`r optend()`


`r qbegin("A1")`

For a given participant in the 'Door Study' video, give a description of the outcome variable of interest, and ask yourself whether it was binary.

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The outcome variable here was "Did the participant notice the person-swap?".  

The values of this are either "Yes" or "No" - they either did or didn't notice that the person they were talking to suddenly changed. 
  
*Be careful:* The video doesn't actually state how they are measuring this - via post-experiment question of "did you notice?", or via what the experimenter perceived to be behaviour which indicated awareness of the swap. *Always think about what exactly you are measuring*.  
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A2")`

Read in the 'drunkdoor' data, and plot (via `ggplot()`) the relationship between `age` and `notice`.   

**Hint**: In `ggplot()`, make sure you use `geom_point()`. Then, add to the plot the following code, `geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)`. This will plot a simple linear regression fit `lm(notice ~ age)`. 

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Read in the data:
```{r}
drunkdoor <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drunkdoor.csv")
head(drunkdoor)
```

Plot whether or not the swap was noticed vs the age. Also add a simple linear model fit, and we use the `fullrange = TRUE` argument so that the line spans the entire plot (rather than just the range of the data):
```{r}
ggplot(drunkdoor, aes(x=age, y=notice)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE) +
  xlim(30, 80)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A3")`
Just visually following the line from the plot produced in the previous question, what do you think the predicted model value would be for someone who is aged 30?  
What does this value *mean*?

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)` 

This plot will make it easier to see that the model predicted value for someone aged 30 is approximately 1.15. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(drunkdoor, aes(x=age, y=notice))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F,fullrange=T)+
  xlim(30,80)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-0.2, 1.2, 0.1)) 
```

But what does **1.15** really mean here? Does it mean that the 30 year old participant will notice 1.15 experimenter-swaps? That doesn't make sense, there is only one swap. Does it mean that they have a 115% probability of noticing the swap? That is closer, but again it doesn't make much sense - how can we have a 115% probability?  

`r solend()`

<br>

What we are really interested in here is looking at how specific factors influence the **probability** of noticing the experimenter-swap. 

We also recall that:

- a probability must be greater than or equal 0
- a probability cannot be larger than 1

Recall that in linear regression we have a term of the following form on the right-hand side of the equal sign
$$
\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \dots + \beta_k x_{ik}
$$
Such term is called a _linear predictor_ because is a linear combination of the predictors. 

The possible values of the linear predictor range from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. On the contrary, a probability ranges from 0 to 1. 

Clearly, we cannot directly model the probability of success as the linear predictor. We need to first transform the probability to range from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ and then it is this transformation of the probability that is related to the linear predictor.

This is where the **Generalised Linear Model (GLM)** comes in. With a little bit of trickery, we can translate probability (restricted to between 0 and 1, and not represented by a straight line), into "log-odds", which is both linear *and* unbounded (see Figure \@ref(fig:plodd)).  

<br>

:::yellow
**Probability, odds, log-odds**  

If we let $p$ denote the probability of a given event, then:  

- The __probability__ $p$ ranges from 0 to 1.

- The __odds__ $\frac{p}{1-p}$ ranges from 0 to $\infty$. 
  
  To see this, consider what happens in the extremes. 
  
  - When $p=0$, $p / (1-p) = 0 / (1-0) = 0/1 = 0$. 
  
  - When $p = 1$, $p / (1-p) = 1 / (1-1) = 1/0 = \infty$.

- The __log-odds__ $\log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right)$ ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. 
  
  To see this, consider again what happens in the extremes. 
  
  - When $\frac{p}{1-p} = 0$, we have $\log(0) = -\infty$.
  
  - When $\frac{p}{1-p} = \infty$ we have $\log(\infty) = \infty$.

```

:::

`r qbegin("A4")`

1. The probability of a coin landing on heads if 0.5, or 50%. What are the odds, and what are the log-odds?    
2. The 2020 Tour de France winner, Tadej Pogacar, was given odds of 11 to 4 by a popular gambling site (i.e., if we could run the race over and over again, for every 4 he won he would lose 11). Translate this into the implied probability of him winning.  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

1. A 50% chance of landing on heads is equivalent to the odds of $\frac{0.5}{1-0.5} = \frac{0.5}{0.5} = \frac{1}{1}$ (odds of 1 to 1, i.e., "equal odds").   
The log-odds can be calculated using `log(1)` in R, which returns `r log(1)`.  
2. If Pogacar is predicted to win 4 for every 11 he loses, then this is means he is predicted to win 4 in every 15 races, so the implied probability of him winning is $\frac{4}{15}$ = `r round(4/15,3)`.  

`r solend()`

How is this useful? 

Recall the linear model formula we have seen a lot of over DAPR2 so far. 
For simplicity, focus on a single predictor $x_{i1}$ but this can be easily generalised to the case of $k$ predictors $x_{i1}, ..., x_{ik}$.

$$
\color{red}{Y_i} = \color{blue}{\beta_0 + \beta_1 \ x_{i1}} + \epsilon_i
$$

Because we are defining a *linear* relationship here, we can't directly model the probabilities (because they are bounded by 0 and 1, and they are not linear). But we *can* model the log-odds of the event happening. 

The logistic regression model requires two components:

- One linking the transformed probability (log-odds) to the linear predictor:
$$
\color{red}{\log \left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \right)} 
= \color{blue}{\beta_0 + \beta_1 \ x_{i1} }
$$

- The second liking the response variable with the probability:
$$
Y_i \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p_i)
$$

For binary responses, $n = 1$.


The following plot displays the effect of varying the intercept and slope (specified respectively as $(a,b)$) on the predicted probability of success.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '85%'}
x = seq(-3, 3, 0.01)
p = function(x,a,b) exp(a + b * x) / (1 + exp(a + b * x))

plot(x, p(x, 0, 1), xlab = '', ylab = '', type = 'l', lwd = 2, 
     frame.plot = FALSE, ylim = c(0, 1))
lines(x, p(x, 2, 3), xlab = '', ylab = '', lty = 2, lwd = 2)
lines(x, p(x, 1, -2), xlab = '', ylab = '', lty = 3, lwd = 2)
legend(1.8, 0.6, legend = c('(0,  1)', '(2,  3)', '(1, -2)'), lty = c(1,2,3))
points(
  seq(-3, 3, len = 50), 
  rbinom(50, size = 1, p(seq(-3, 3, len = 50), 0, 1)),
  col = 'darkgray')
```

In the above plot it seems like the best curve to fit the probability of success is the one obtained with $\beta_0 = 2$ and $\beta_1 = 3$ (dashed line). The dotted line is the worst fit as it gives a high probability of success in an area of no observed success and a low probability of success in an area of high observed successes.



`r optbegin("A bit of a tangent - How does the model get estimated?", FALSE, show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
**Maximum Likelihood Estimation**  

For a linear regression, we heard about how the regression line can be found by "minimising the residual sums of squares" (i.e., we rotate the line to find the point at which $\sum{(y - \hat{y})^2}$ is smallest. This gave us the "best fitting line" (Figure \@ref(fig:resslineplot)).  
```{r resslineplot, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.align='center',  fig.cap="https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/lectures/dapR2_lec03_LMintro.html#24"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/glm/ssdapr2.png")
```

For the logistic regression model, what we're really wanting is the "best fitting *squiggle*" (Figure \@ref(fig:loglineplot)), and to get to this we must do something else. 
```{r loglineplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The sigmoid curve"}
drunkdoor %>%
ggplot(aes(x=age,y=notice)) +
  ylab("p(noticed swap)") +
  geom_jitter(size=3,height=.02,alpha=.1) +
  geom_smooth(method="glm",method.args=list(family=binomial),se=F) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,1,by=.2))
```
The reason we have to do something different is because for our actual observations, the event has either happened or it hasn't. So we can't take the raw data as "probabilities" which we can translate into log-odds. We can try, but it doesn't make sense, and we would just be trying to fit some line between infinity and negative infinity. This would mean the residuals would also all be infinity, and so it becomes impossible to work out anything!  
```{r}
drunkdoor %>% 
  mutate(
    notice_odds = notice/(1-notice),
    notice_logodds = log(notice_odds)
  )
```

Instead, *maximum likelihood estimation* is used to find the set of coefficients which best reproduce the observed data.  
  
For a given line on the plot where y = log-odds, and x = predictor variable, we can project our points on to it to find some candidate log-odd values for each observation, which we can then compare to the observed data (the 0s and 1s, or -Inf and Inf on the log-odds scale).   
  
Consider three possible lines we might fit below. You can see the observations at the `Inf` and `-Inf` points of the y-axis, and they are coloured by whether the event was observed or not. These are then projected down on to the possible lines. Recall that a log-odds of 0 is 50/50, or an odds of 1.  
In the left hand plot, all of the observations where the event *was* observed to happen (red dots at log-odds of +Inf), are modelled as having a log-odds of > 0 (red dots on the line). However, so are a lot of the observations where the event was *not* observed (blue dots at log-odds of -Inf).  
In the middle plot, some red dots get incorrectly given log-odds < 0, and a lot of blue dots get incorrectly given log-odds > 0. 
The right hand plot seems to fit a little better - there are only a few points which get given log-odds the wrong way from what we would expect.

If we take that right-hand plot above, and translate the log-odds back into probabilities, we see the squiggle!

  #scale_y_continuous(NULL,breaks=c(-4,0,4), labels=c("-Inf","0","Inf"))+
  guides(col=FALSE)

p1 + p2
```
  
What we can then ask for each of our candidate lines "what is the likelihood of the data, given this line?". To get this, we sum up the probabilities that observed 1s are predicted as 1s and that observed 0s predicted as 0s, at some given threshold which defines what we count as "predicted as 1" (e.g., is the predicted prob < or > 0.5?).    
For instance, the furthest right point is an observed 0, and so the likelihood of this data given the predicted probability is 1-0.04, or 0.96.  
```{r echo=FALSE}
p2+ geom_label(aes(x=78, y=0.1),label="0.04") +
  geom_label(aes(x=38, y=0.83),label="0.89")
```

The cool thing is that computers do all this for us. *Maximum likelihood estimation* is just a method to find out which parameters maximise the likelihood of the data. In our context, it tells us what values of coefficients in $\color{red}{\log \left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \right)} = \color{blue}{\beta_0  + \beta_1 x_{i1} }$ maximise the likelihood of reproducing the data we observed.   
`r optend()`


`r qbegin("A5")`
To fit a logistic regression model, we need to use`glm()`, a slightly more general form of `lm()`.  
The syntax is pretty much the same, but we need to add in a `family` at the end, to tell it that we are doing a *binomial logistic* regression.  
(Note, we've been calling our outcome variable "binary", but now we use "binomial"? Why? Well in the situation that we have a binary outcome consisting of 2 categories represented by 1s and 0s, we actually have a special case of a binomial ("the number of successes in n trials") where $n=1$, which is why it often gets referred to as 'binary logistic regression') 

Using the `drunkdoor.csv` data, fit a model investigating whether participants' age predicts the log-odds of noticing the person they are talking to be switched out mid-conversation. Look at the `summary()` output of your model.  

:::blue  
  
+ `lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data)`  
+ is the same as:  
+ `glm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, family = "gaussian")`  
  
([Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss) is another name for the normal distribution)
:::
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
model1 <- glm(notice ~ age, data = drunkdoor, family="binomial")
summary(model1)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A6")`
Interpreting coefficients from a logistic regression can be difficult at first.  
Recall what we are modelling - we are no longer modelling $y$, but the log-odds of $y$.  
Based on your model output, complete the following sentence:  

"Being 1 year older decreases _________ by 0.13."
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
"Being 1 year older decreases **the log-odds of noticing a mid-conversation person switch** by 0.13."  
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A7")`
Unfortunately, if we talk about increases/decreases in log-odds, it's not that intuitive.  
What we often do is translate this back into odds.  
The opposite of the natural logarithm is the exponential (see [here](http://mathonweb.com/help_ebook/html/functions_3.htm) for more details if you are interested), and in R these functions are `log()` and `exp()`:   

```{r}
log(2)
exp(log(2))
log(exp(0.6931472))
```

Exponentiate the coefficients from your model in order to translate them back from log-odds, and provide an interpretation of what the resulting numbers mean.  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
exp(coef(model1))
```
:::int 
The odds of noticing a mid-conversation person-switch for someone age 0 is 1282:1.  
For every year older someone is, the odds of noticing reduces by a factor of 0.88. 
:::
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A8")`
Based on your answer to the previous question, calculate the odds of noticing the swap for a one year-old (for now, forget about the fact that this experiment wouldn't work on a 1 year old!)  
And what about for a 40 year old?  

Can you translate the odds back to probabilities?  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
exp(coef(model1))
```
>The odds of noticing a mid-conversation person-switch for someone age 0 is 1282:1.  
For every year older someone is, the odds of noticing reduces by a factor of 0.88. 

This means that for a one year old, the odds of noticing are $1282*0.88$, or 1129:1.  
The odds for a 40 year old are $1282*0.88^{40}$, or 7.71:1  

And we can always then turn these back into probabilities. 

From probabilities to log-odds (or logit):  
$$
logit_i=\log \left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right)
$$
From log-odds to probability:  
$$
p_i=\frac{e^{logit_i}}{(1+e^{logit_i})}
$$

Predicted probability of noticing for a one year old = $\frac{1129}{1 + 1129} = 0.99$
Predicted probability of noticing for a 40 year old = $\frac{7.71}{1 + 7.71} = 0.89$  
`r solend()` 

`r qbegin("A9")`
We can easily get R to extract these predicted probabilities for us.  

+ Calculate the predicted log-odds (probabilities on the logit scale):  `predict(model, type="link")`  
+ Calculate the predicted probabilities: `predict(model, type="response")`   
  
The code below creates a dataframe with the variable `age` in it, which has the values 1 to 100. Can you use this object in the `predict()` function, along with your model, to calculate the predicted probabilities of the outcome (noticing the swap) for each value of age? How about then plotting them?  
```{r}
ages100 <- tibble(age = 1:100)
```
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
This will spit out 100 predicted probabilities.. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
predict(model1, newdata = ages100, type = "response")
```

Let's add them to the `ages100` tibble
```{r}
ages100 <- 
  ages100 %>%
  mutate(
    predprobs = predict(model1, newdata = ages100, type = "response")
  )
```

and plot them against age!
```{r}
ggplot(data = ages100, aes(x = age, y = predprobs)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(y="predicted probability of noticing the swap")
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A10")`

Shortcut! 

We can do this really easily with the **sjPlot** package! 
Try running this code (replace `model1` with the name of your model):
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sjPlot)
plot_model(model1, type="pred")
```

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
library(sjPlot)
plot_model(model1, type="pred")
```

`r solend()`


`r qbegin("A11")`
We have the following model coefficients, in terms of log-odds: 
```{r}
summary(model1)$coefficients
```
We can convert these to odds by using `exp()`:
```{r}
exp(coef(model1))
```
In order to say something along the lines of "For every year older someone is, the odds of noticing the mid-conversation swap (the outcome event happening) reduces by a factor of 0.88."   
  
Why can we **not** translate this into a straightforward statement about the change in *probability* of the outcome for every year older someone is?  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We have to be careful - we are talking about an odds *ratio*.  

Our model holds that a 21 year old has 0.88 the odds that a 20 year old has, and that a 51 year old has 0.88 the odds of a 50 year old. 
But these are not the same in terms of probability. The probability between age and the probability isn't linear, it is sigmoidal.

```{r}
example <- tibble(
  age = c(20,21,50,51)
)

example <- 
  example %>% mutate(
    logodds = predict(model1, newdata = example, type = "link"),
    odds = exp(logodds),
    probs = predict(model1, newdata = example, type = "response"),
  )

example
```

+ In log odds the difference is constant (it is a linear relationship):  
    ```{r}
    example$logodds[example$age == 21] - example$logodds[example$age == 20]
    example$logodds[example$age == 51] - example$logodds[example$age == 50]
    ```

- Translated back into odds, the difference is not constant:
    ```{r}
    example$odds[example$age == 21] - example$odds[example$age == 20]
    example$odds[example$age == 51] - example$odds[example$age == 50]
    ```
    the multiplication, however, IS constant (this is the odds ratio):
    ```{r}
    example$odds[example$age == 21]/example$odds[example$age == 20]
    example$odds[example$age == 51]/example$odds[example$age == 50]
    ```
- This is the same thing we saw visually in Figure \@ref(fig:plodd)!  

`r solend()`


# GLM as a classifier  

`r qbegin("B1")`
From the model we created in the earlier exercises:  

```{r eval=FALSE}
model1 <- glm(notice ~ age, data = drunkdoor, family="binomial")
```

1. Add new column to the drunkdoor dataset which contains the predicted probability of the outcome for each observation.  
2. Then, using `ifelse()`, add another column which is these predicted probabilities translated into the predicted binary outcome (0 or 1) based on whether the probability is greater than >.5.  
3. Create a two-way contingency table of the predicted outcome and the observed outcome.  

*Hint:* you don't need the `newdata` argument for `predict()` if you want to use the original data the model was fitted on.  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
drunkdoor <-
  drunkdoor %>%
  mutate(
    predprobs = predict(model1, type="response"),
    predclass = ifelse(predprobs > 0.5, 1, 0)
  )


drunkdoor %>%
  select(notice, predclass) %>%
  table()
```
`r solend()`

A table of predicted outcome vs observed outcome sometimes gets referred to as a *confusion matrix*, and we can think of the different cells in general terms (Figure \@ref(fig:confmat)).  
Another way to think about how our model is fitted is that it aims to maximise (TP + TN)/n, or, put another way, to minimise (FP+FN)/n.  
Which is equivalent to the good old idea of minimising sums of squares (where we minimise the extend to which the predicted values differ from the observed values).  
```{r confmat, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Confusion Matrix"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/glm/cmat.png")
```

`r qbegin("B2")`
What percentage of the n = `r nrow(drunkdoor)` observations are correctly classified by our model, when the threshold is set at 0.5? 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
sum(drunkdoor$predclass == drunkdoor$notice) / nrow(drunkdoor)
```
The model correctly classifies `r sum(drunkdoor$predclass == drunkdoor$notice) / nrow(drunkdoor) * 100`% of the observations.  
`r solend()`


# Less guided exercises  

## Approaching a research question  

`r qbegin("C1")`
Recall our research question, which we will now turn to:  

> **Research Questions**
> Is susceptibility to change blindness influenced by level of alcohol intoxication and perceptual load?  

Try and make a mental list of the different relationships between variables that this question invokes, can you identify one variable as the 'outcome' or 'response' variable? (it often helps to think about the implicit direction of the relationship in the question)  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

The question seems to ask about two relationships:  

+ susceptibility to change blindness &#8592; alcohol intoxication  
+ susceptibility to change blindness &#8592; perceptual load  

The arrows above are used to show the implied direction of the influence, and in the `lm()/glm()` syntax, you could imagine each of these mapping to a formula syntax we have seen a few times (e.g., `t.test(data$outcome ~ data$group)` and `lm(outcome ~ predictor)`). We can see that the 'susceptibility to change blindness' is our outcome variable:  

+ `change blindness ~ alcohol`
+ `change blindness ~ perceptual load` 

As a general rule of thumb, it is often worth asking yourself "why run two models when one will do?". Think about what we have learned about moving from simple to multiple regression - some of the explanatory power of `x` in the relationship `y~x` might be shared by the relationship `y~z`. 
This will depend on precisely what quantity you want to estimate, i.e., "the overall effect of $x$ on $y$ *independent of $z$*" or "the effect of $x$ on $y$ *after partialling out the effect of $z$ on $y$*". The former statement might indicate a simple bivariate relationship, and the latter requires more advanced techniques (e.g., multiple regression).  

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("C2")`
Think about our outcome variable and how it is measured. What type of data is it? Numeric? Categorical?  
What type of distribution does it follow? For instance, do values vary around a central point, or fall into one of various categories, or follow the count of successes in a number of trials? 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Our outcome variable here is `drunkdoor$notice`, and is stored as a set of 0s and 1s. These are the only two values that an observation can take, and they represent the number of successes in $n = 1$ trials.  

So, from this we learn that our method of analysis should be suited to model this binary outcome. So things like `lm()` and `t.test()` are not very appropriate.  
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("C3")`
Think about our explanatory variable(s). Is there more than one? What type of variables are they? Do we want to model these together? Might they be correlated?  
Are there any other variables (measured or unmeasured) which our prior knowledge or theory suggests might be relevant?  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We know that `drunkdoor$bac` is simply the observed blood alcohol level (BAC). This is technically measured as a proportion, but for the current purposes we can just treat it as any other numeric scale. However, we might consider scaling the variable so that instead of the coefficient representing the change when moving from 0% to 1% BAC (1% blood alcohol is fatal!), we might want to have the change associated with 0% to 0.01% BAC (i.e, a we want to talk about effects in terms of changing 1/100th of a percentage of BAC). 
The `drunkdoor$condition` variable is an experimental manipulation. That is, the researchers had control over what observations fell into which group. We wouldn't therefore expect any correlation between this and the `bac` variable (unless researchers did not allocate participants to conditions randomly).  

If we were actually doing research in this area, we might already have the idea based on previous research that change-blindness appears to vary depending upon age. From the earlier exercises here we have some evidence to corroborate this. We may therefore want to include this in our model. If we don't, any results might simply be due to, e.g. older people tending to be more highly intoxicated (and so we see an effects of alcohol that might actually be simply the effect of age). 
  
We might also think about any other possible variables which might influence our results, even if we didn't measure them. This sort of thinking becomes important in the discussion section.

**John Stuart Mill - Three Criteria for Causality**  
To varying extents, all of these criteria can be incredibly difficult to satisfy. Criteria 3 especially is one of the things that makes scientific investigation so interesting. 

1) The cause precedes the effect
2) The cause is demonstrably related to the effect
3) There are no plausible alternative explanations

## Fitting the model  

`r qbegin("C4")`

1. Write a sentence describing the model you will fit. It might help to also describe each variable as you introduce it. 
2. Fit the model.  


**Things to think about:**  

- Do you want BAC on the current scale, or could you transform it somehow? 
- Is condition a factor? What is your reference level? Have you checked `contrasts(drunkdoor$condition)`? (This will only work if you make it a factor first)

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

:::int 
Whether or not participants noticed the swap mid-conversation (binary 0 vs 1) was modelled using logistic regression, with blood alcohol content (measured in 100th of percentages blood content) and perceptual load condition (low load vs high load, with low as the reference level) and age (years).  
:::

In the sentence above, I stated that I want blood alcohol in terms of 100ths of percentages, rather than percentages.
```{r}
drunkdoor <- drunkdoor %>% 
  mutate(
    bac100 = bac*100
  )
```

I also stated that the low-load will be the reference level.  
Currently it is the other way around:
```{r}
# make it a factor
drunkdoor$condition<-factor(drunkdoor$condition)
contrasts(drunkdoor$condition)
```
So let's change it:
```{r}
# change 0,1 column to 1,0, and rename it so it 
# compares high against low (not low against high)
contrasts(drunkdoor$condition) <- cbind(High=c(1,0))
contrasts(drunkdoor$condition)
```
```{r}
changeblind_model <- glm(notice ~ bac100 + condition + age, data = drunkdoor, family = "binomial")
summary(changeblind_model)
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("C5")`
Compute 95% confidence intervals for the log-odds coefficients using `confint()`. Wrap the whole thing in `exp()` in order to convert all these back into odds and odds-ratios.   

Try the **sjPlot** package and using `plot_model()` on your model, but with `type="est"`. What do you get? 
**Tip:**, for some people this plots seems to miss out plotting the BAC effect, so you might need to add: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_model(model, type="est") +
  scale_y_log10(limits = c(1e-05,10))
```


`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
confint(changeblind_model)
exp(confint(changeblind_model))

sjPlot::plot_model(changeblind_model, type = "est")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=1)+
  scale_y_log10(limits = c(1e-05,10))
```

`r solend()`
