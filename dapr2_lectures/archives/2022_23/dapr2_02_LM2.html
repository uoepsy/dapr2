# Week's Learning Objectives
1. Understand the key principles of least squares. 

2. Be able to interpret the coefficients from a simple linear model.

3. Understand how these interpretations change when we add more predictors

---
# Linear Model
+ Last week we left off having introduced the linear model:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Where,
  + `\(y_i\)` is our measured outcome variable
  + `\(x_i\)` is our measured predictor variable
  + `\(\beta_0\)` is the model intercept
  + `\(\beta_1\)` is the model slope
  + `\(\epsilon_i\)` is the residual error (difference between the model predicted and the observed value of `\(y\)`)

+ Where we are going to pick up, is how we calculate `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)`

---
# Principle of least squares

+ The values `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` are typically **unknown** and need to be estimated from our data. 

+ We denote the "best" estimated values as `\(\hat \beta_0\)` and `\(\hat \beta_1\)`

+ We find the best values for `\(\hat \beta_0\)` and `\(\hat \beta_1\)` (and thus our best line) using **least squares**
    
+ Least squares;
  + Minimizes the distances between the actual values of `\(y\)` and the model-predicted values of `\(\hat y\)`
  + That is, it minimizes the residuals for each data point (the line is "close")

---
# Principle of least squares

+ Formally, least squares minimizes the **residual sum of squares**

+ Essentially:
  + Fit a line.
  + Calculate the residuals
  + Square them
  + Sum up the squares
  
+ **Why do you think we square the deviations? **


---
# Residual Sum of Squares

`$$SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$`
+ Data = `\(y_i\)`
    + This is what we have measured in our study. 
    + For us, the test scores.

+ Predicted value = `\(\hat{y}_i = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_i\)` 
    + Or, the value of the outcome our model predicts given someone's values for predictors.
    + In our example, given you study for 4 hours, what test score does our model predict you will get.

+ Residual = Difference between `\(y_i\)` and `\(\hat{y}_i\)`.



---
# Key Point

+ It is worth a brief pause as this is a very important point.

&gt; The values of the intercept and slope that minimize the sum of square residual are our estimated coefficients from our data.

--

&gt; Minimizing the `\(SS_{residual}\)` means that across all our data, the predicted values from our model are as close as they can be to the actual measured values of the outcome.


---
# Calculating the slope

+ Calculations for slope:

`$$\hat \beta_1 = \frac{SP_{xy}}{SS_x}$$`


+ `\(SP_{xy}\)` = sum of cross-products:


`$$SP_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$$`


+ `\(SS_x\)` = sums of squared deviations of `\(x\)`:


`$$SS_x = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2$$`


---
# Calculating the intercept

+ Calculations for intercept:

`$$\hat \beta_0 = \bar{y} - \hat \beta_1 \bar{x}$$`

+ `\(\hat \beta_1\)` = slope estimate

+ `\(\bar{y}\)` = mean of `\(y\)`

+ `\(\bar{x}\)` = mean of `\(x\)`

# Time for a little R and to look at an example hand calculation.


---
# `lm` in R
+ We do not generally calculate our linear models by hand. So lets look at how we do this in R.

+ In R, we use the `lm()` function.


```r
lm(DV ~ IV, data = )
```

+ The first bit of code is the model formula:
  + The outcome or DV appears on the left of ~
  + The predictor(s) or IV appear on the right of ~

+ We then give R the name of the data set
  + This set must contain variables (columns) with the same names as you have specified in the model formula.

---
# `lm` in R

```r
test &lt;- tibble(
  student = paste(rep("ID",10),1:10, sep=""),
  hours = seq(0.5,5,.5),
  score = c(1,3,1,2,2,6,3,3,4,8)
)
```


```r
lm(score ~ hours, data = test)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = score ~ hours, data = test)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)        hours  
##       0.400        1.055
```

---
# Interpretation

+ **Slope is the number of units by which Y increases, on average, for a unit increase in X.**

--
    + Unit of Y = 1 point on the test
    + Unit of X = 1 hour of study
    
--

+ So, for every hour of study, test score increases on average by 1.055 points.

--

+ **Intercept is the expected value of Y when X is 0.**

--

    + X = 0 is a student who does not study.

--

+ So, a student who does no study would be expected to score 0.40 on the test.


---
# Note of caution on intercepts
+ In our example, 0 has a meaning.
    + It is a student who has studied for 0 hours.
    
+ But it is not always the case that 0 is meaningful.

+ Suppose our predictor variable was not hours of study, but age.

+ **Look back at the interpretation of the intercept, and instead of hours of study, insert age. Read this aloud a couple of times.**

--

+ This is the first instance of a very general lesson about interpreting statistical tests. 
    + The interpretation is always in the context of the constructs and how we have measured them.

# Congratulations, we have just run our first linear model. Questions...

# A little more to say on residuals

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Recall last lecture we said that `\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma)\)` independently.

+ This means `\(\epsilon_i\)` ...
  + are distributed ( `\(\sim\)` )
    + a normal distribution ( `\(N\)` )
      + with a mean of 0 ( `\(N(0,\)` )
        + and a standard deviation of `\(\sigma\)`
  
+ `\(\sigma\)` = standard deviation (spread) of the errors
  + `\(\sigma\)`, is constant, meaning that at any point along the x-axis, the spread of the residuals should be the same.

+ The less scatter around the line, 
  + the smaller the standard deviation of the errors
  + the stronger the relationship between `\(y\)` and `\(x\)`. 

---
# What is `\(\sigma\)`?

+ We estimate `\(\sigma\)` using the residuals from our model

+ The estimated standard deviation of the errors is:
`$$\hat \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{SS_{Residual}}{n - k - 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat y_i)^2}{n - k - 1}}$$`

+ In simple linear regression we only have one `\(x\)`, so `\(k = 1\)` and the denominator becomes `\(n - 2\)`.

+ `\(\sigma\)` and its properties will turn up a few times in this course.

# What happens if we have more than one predictor?

---
#  Multiple predictors (multiple regression)
+ The aim of a linear model is to explain variance in an outcome

+ In simple linear models, we have a single predictor, but the model can accommodate (in principle) any number of predictors. 

+ However, when we include multiple predictors, those predictors are likely to correlate.

+ Thus, a linear model with multiple predictors finds the optimal prediction of the outcome from several predictors, **taking into account their redundancy with one another**


---
#  Uses of multiple regression 
+ **For prediction:** multiple predictors may lead to improved prediction. 

+ **For theory testing:** often our theories suggest that multiple variables together contribute to variation in an outcome

+ **For covariate control:** we might want to assess the effect of a specific predictor, controlling for the influence of others.
	+ E.g., effects of personality on health after removing the effects of age and sex


---
#  Extending the regression model 

+ Our model for a single predictor:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \epsilon_i$$` 

+ is extended to include additional `\(x\)`'s:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_3 x_{3i} + \epsilon_i$$`  

+ For each `\(x\)`, we have an additional `\(b\)`
  + `\(\beta_1\)` is the coefficient for the 1st predictor
  + `\(\beta_2\)` for the second etc.


---
#  Interpreting coefficients in multiple regression 

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_j x_{ji} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Given that we have additional variables, our interpretation of the regression coefficients changes a little

+ `\(\beta_0\)` = the predicted value for `\(y\)` **all** `\(x\)` are 0.
	
+ Each `\(\beta_j\)` is now a **partial regression coefficient**
	+ It captures the change in `\(y\)` for a one unit change in , `\(x\)` **when all other x's are held constant**

---
# What does holding constant mean? 

+ Refers to finding the effect of the predictor when the values of the other predictors are fixed

+ It may also be expressed as the effect of **controlling for**, or **partialling out**, or **residualizing for** the other `\(x\)`'s

+ With multiple predictors `lm` isolates the effects and estimates the unique contributions of predictors.

???
+ In simple linear models, we could visualise the model as a straight line in 2D space
	+ Least squares finds the coefficients that produces the *regression line* that minimises the vertical distances of the observed y-values from the line

+ In a regression with  2 predictors, this becomes a regression plane in 3D space
	+ The goal now becomes finding the set of coefficients that minimises the vertical distances between the *regression*  *plane* and the observed y-values

+ The logic extends to any number of predictors
	+ (but becomes very difficult to visualise!)

---
#  Example: lm with 2 predictors 



+ Imagine we extend our study of test scores.

+ We sample 150 students taking a multiple choice Biology exam (max score 40).

+ We give all students a survey at the start of the year measuring their school motivation. 
  + We standardize this variable so the mean is 0, negative numbers are low motivation, and positive numbers high motivation. 
  
+ We then measure the hours they spent studying for the test, and collate their scores on the test.

# Summary
+ Key take homes

1. We find our model coefficients based on least squares
2. These are the coefficients which minimize the sum of squared residuals
3. We run linear models using `lm()` in R
4. The intercept is the value of `\(Y\)` when `\(X\)` = 0
5. The slope is the unit change in `\(Y\)` for each unit change in `\(X\)`
6. We can easily add more predictors to our model
7. When we do, our interpretations of the coefficients are when all other predictors are held constant.

# For next week
+ Things to recap...

  + We will look again at significance testing.
  + And also discuss sampling variability.

+ If you want a refresh, go back and review sampling and hypothesis testing material from dapR1 !(here)[https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr1/2122/index.html]
