# Where we left off...
+ Last week we looked at:
  + The significance of individual predictors
  + Overall model evaluation through $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ to see how much variance in the outcome has been explained.

+ Today we will:
  + Look at significance tests of the overall model
  + Discuss how we can use the same tools to do incremental tests (how much does my model improve when I add variables)
  + Interpreting models based on standardized coefficients.

---
#  Significance of the overall model 
+ The test of the individual predictors (IVs, or $x$'s) does not tell us if the overall model is significant or not.
	+ Neither does R-square
	+ But both are indicative

+ To test the significance of the model as a whole, we conduct an $F$-test.


---
#  F-test & F-ratio
+ An $F$-test involves testing the statistical significance of a test statistic called (wait for it) the $F$-ratio.

+ The $F$-ratio tests the null hypothesis that all the regression slopes in a model are all zero.

--

  + In other words, our predictors tell us nothing about our outcome.
  + They explain no variance.

--

  + If our predictors do explain some variance, our $F$-ratio will be significant.

#  F-ratio: Some details
+ $F$-ratio is a ratio of the explained to unexplained variance:

$$F = \frac{\frac{SS_{model}}{df_{model}}}{\frac{SS_{residual}}{df_{residual}}} = \frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{Residual}}$$

+ Where MS = mean squares

--

+ **What are mean squares?**
  + Mean squares are sums of squares calculations divided by the associated degrees of freedom.
  + We saw how to calculate model and residual sums of squares last week

+ But what are degrees of freedom...

---
# Degrees of freedom
+ The degrees of freedom are defined as the number of independent values associated with the different calculations.
  + Df are typically the combination of the amount of data you have (sample size) and the number of things you need to calculate/estimate.

+ **Residual degrees of freedom = n-k-1**
  + $SS_{residual}$ calculation is based on our model, in which we estimate k $\beta$ terms (-k) and an intercept (-1)

+ **Total degrees of freedom = n-1**
  + $SS_{total}$ calculation is based on the observed $y_i$ and $\bar{y}$ . 
  + In order to estimate $\bar{y}$ , all apart from one value of $y$ is free to vary, hence n-1

+ **Model degrees of freedom = k**
  + $SS_{model}$ are dependent on estimated $\beta$ , hence k.

# F-ratio
+ Bigger $F$-ratios indicate better models.
  + It means the model variance is big compared to the residual variance.

--

+ The null hypothesis for the model says that the best guess of any individuals $y$ value is the mean of $y$ plus error.
	+ Or, that the $x$ variables carry no information collectively about $y$.
	+ I.e. the slopes all = 0

--

+ $F$-ratio will be close to 1 when the null hypothesis is true
  + If there is equivalent residual to model variation, $F$=1
	+ If there is more model than residual $F$ > 1

---
# Testing the significance of $F$

+ The $F$-ratio is our test statistic for the significance of our model. 
  + As with all statistical inferences, we would select an $\alpha$ level.
  + Calculate the critical value of $F$ associated with this.
  + And then compare our value to the critical value.
  
+ The $F$-ratio is then evaluated against an $F$-distribution with $df_{Model}$ and $df_{Residual}$ and a pre-defined $\alpha$
  + This provides us with the test of the overall model.

# Unstandardized vs standardized coefficients
- So far we have calculated unstandardized $\hat \beta_1$.

+ We interpreted the slope as the change in $y$ units for a unit change in $x$
  + Where the unit is determined by how we have measured our variables.

+ In our running example:
  + A unit of study time is 1 hour.
  + A unit of test score is 1 point.
  
+ However, sometimes we may want to represent our results in standard units.

---
# Standardized units
+ Why might standard units be useful?

--

+ **If the scales of our variables are arbitrary.**
  + Example: A sum score of questionnaire items answered on a Likert scale.
  + A unit here would equal moving from a 2 to 3 on one item.
  + This is not especially meaningful (and actually has A LOT of associated assumptions)

--

+ **If we want to compare the effects of variables on different scales**
  + If we want to say something like, the effect of $x_1$ is stronger than the effect of $x_2$, we need a common scale.


---
# Standardizing the coefficients
+ After calculating a $\hat \beta_1$, it can be standardized by:


$$\hat{\beta_1^*} = \hat \beta_1 \frac{s_x}{s_y}$$

+ where;
  + $\hat{\beta_1^*}$ = standardized beta coefficient
  + $\hat \beta_1$ = unstandardized beta coefficient
  + $s_x$ = standard deviation of $x$
  + $s_y$ = standard deviation of $y$


---
# Standardizing the variables

+ Alternatively, for continuous variables, transforming both the IV and DV to $z$-scores (mean=0, SD=1) prior to fitting the model yields standardised betas.

+ $z$-score for $x$:

$$z_{x_i} = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}$$

+ and the $z$-score for $y$:

$$z_{y_i} = \frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}$$

+ That is, we divide the individual deviations from the mean by the standard deviation

# Two approaches in action


```{r}
test_study2 <- test_study2 %>%
  mutate(
    z_score = scale(score, center = T, scale = T),
    z_hours = scale(hours, center = T, scale = T),
    z_motivation = scale(motivation, center = T, scale = T)
  )

performance_z <- lm(z_score ~ z_hours + z_motivation, data = test_study2) #<<
round(summary(performance_z)$coefficients,3)
```


---
#  Interpreting standardized regression coefficients  
+ $R^2$ , $F$ and $t$-test remain the same for the standardized coefficients as for unstandardised coefficients.

+ $b_0$ (intercept) = zero when all variables are standardized:
$$
\bar{y} - \hat \beta_1 \bar{x} = 0 - \hat \beta_1  0 = 0
$$

+ The interpretation of the coefficients becomes the increase in $y$ in standard deviation units for every standard deviation increase in $x$

+ So, in our example:

>**For every standard deviation increase in hours of study, test score increases by 0.82 standard deviations**


---
# Which should we use? 
+ Unstandardized regression coefficients are often more useful when the variables are on  meaningful scales
	+ E.g. X additional hours of exercise per week adds Y years of healthy life

+ Sometimes it's useful to obtain standardized regression coefficients
	+ When the scales of variables are arbitrary
	+ When there is a desire to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales	

+ Cautions
	+ Just because you can put regression coefficients on a common metric doesn't mean they can be meaningfully compared.
	+ The SD is a poor measure of spread for skewed distributions, therefore, be cautious of their use with skewed variables

# Relationship to correlation ( $r$ )
+ Standardized slope ( $\hat \beta_1^*$ ) = correlation coefficient ( $r$ ) for a linear model with a single continuous predictor.

+ For example:

```{r}
round(lm(z_score ~ z_hours, data = test_study2)$coefficients, 2)
```


```{r}
round(cor(test_study2$hours, test_study2$score),2)
```

---
# Relationship to correlation ( $r$ )

+ They are the same:
  + $r$ is a standardized measure of linear association
  + $\hat \beta_1^*$ is a standardized measure of the linear slope.

+ Something similar is true for linear models with multiple predictors.
  + Slopes are equivalent to the *part correlation coefficient*
  

---
# Writing up Results
+ What should we include:
  + A full results table formatted (`tab_model`)
  + A comment on the overall model ( $F$-test, $R^2$ , adjusted- $R^2$)
  + A comment on the significance of key $\beta$ coefficients
  + An interpretation of those $\beta$ coefficients

+ We will also need to comment on our model checks (but we wont talk about how to do these until week 9)

???
Perhaps look at some examples of published papers

# `tab_model` (very basic table)

# Pause to summarise what we know so far

+ So far we have seen how to:
  + run a linear model with a single predictor
  + extend this and add predictors
  + interpret these coefficients either in original units or standardized units
  + test the significance of $\beta$ coefficients
  + test the significance of the overall model
  + estimate the amount of variance explained by our model

+ Short version, well done, you can now run and interpret linear models with continuous predictors.

+ We have a fair bit more to discuss in this course, but this is a great start!
  + Next week we will look at categorical predictor variables.
