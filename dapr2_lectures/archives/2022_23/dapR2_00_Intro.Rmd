# What is R? 
+ A very flexible programming language for all things data.
  + It does pretty much any statistical method you can think of. (Cool? I think so)
  + But it does a lot more.

+ We will also continue to teach you Rmarkdown 
  + this is a really neat way to integrate text and analysis
  + and to write reproducible documents and analyses
  
+ Open source (free) software

---
# What is R? 
+ Huge community worldwide which means lots of free resources in addition to your course materials

--

+ Some examples:
  + [interactive plots](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html) 
  + [interactive dashboards](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/086-bus-dashboard/) 
  + Documents with automatically include results from analysis
  + [books](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/)
  + [websites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
  + Presentations (like the one you are looking at)


---
# dapR 2 
+ In dapR2, we will teach you how to...

--

  + Deal with data in R, tidy it, describe it and visualize it

--

  + Run, interpret and use linear models for observational designs
  
--

  + Run, interpret and use linear models for experimental designs
  
--

  + Introduce the basic concepts of the generalized linear model

--

  + Talk about some common issues when applying the linear model to data.


---
# dapR2 building from dapR1

+ dapR2 builds on dapR1

+ Core concepts:
  + types of data
  + plotting
  + significance testing
  + bootstrap
  + correlation
  + independent t-tests

+ You can access these materials via the welcome week folder in LEARN
  
---
# dapR 2 

+ The course will help develop a large number of transferable skills:

--

  + Working with data

--

  + Logical thinking and problem solving

--

  + Collaborative working (in labs solving the lab problems)
  
--

  + Report writing (taking something complex, and presenting it in a digestible way)

---
# dapR2

+ Semester 1:
  + Weeks 1 to 4: Basics of the linear model
  + Weeks 5 to 7: Interactions
  + Weeks 8 to 10: Robustness checks for our models

--

+ Semester 2:
  + Weeks 1 to 5: Working with categorical data and analysing experiments
  + Weeks 6 to 10: What if.....
  
---
# Basis for dapR 3 (Hons Stats) 
+ In dapR3, we will teach you how to...

--

  + Run, interpret and use linear mixed models to analyse repeated measures data

--

  + Run, interpret and use data reduction techniques

--

  + Run, interpret and use path models for testing more complex relations between variables

---
# dapR2 Course Delivery

+ **Lectures**
  + Two 50 minute lectures per week.
  + These will be a mix of new content are practical demonstration/Q&A (like the Live R's last year)
  + ***Core purpose***: Learning new material

--

+ **Labs**
  + 1 hour per week in person labs (note these may take more than 1 hour to complete = self-study expected)
  + Structured reading and exercises with R.
  + ***Core purpose***: VERY important sessions for practical skills.

---
# dapR2 Course Delivery

+ **Supported by**
  + Office hours (see LEARN for times)
  + Piazza discussion boards (monitored daily)
  + ***Core purpose***: Resolving ambiguities and questions, helping answer others questions

--

+ **Reading**
  + All reading is from free to access sources.
  + You do not need to buy a book and should be able to access everything electronically.
  + ***Core purpose***: Scaffolding knowledge


---
# dapR2: Assessment (the facts)
+ **Weekly quizzes** (10%)
  + 20 quizzes in total 
  + Quizzes 1 and 2 are practices.
  + The rest comprise your grade.
  + Mark is the average of your best 14/18 scores.

--

+ **Coursework report** (30%)
  + Early semester 2
  + Provided a dataset and some questions
  + Task is to construct models to answer the questions, describe them, run them, report the results.

--

+ **Exam** (60%)
  + Summer exam block
  + Mix of MCQ, short answer R/calculation, and larger interpretation questions.
  + Closed book
  + You will be given an equation sheet. You will be allowed to make notes on this sheet and take it into the exam. 
    + There will be strict rules on this, if they are not followed, your notes sheet will be taken away and replaced with a blank equation sheet.


---
# dapR2: Assessment (the reason)
+ **Weekly quizzes** (10%)
  + Encourage continual engagement
  + Act as a knowledge check for you each week to monitor your progress

--

+ **Coursework report** (30%)
  + To practice working with data, converting questions to models, and interpreting results.
  + This is what you will be doing in your Mini-dissertation (year 3) and dissertation (year 4)

--

+ **Exam** (60%)
  + Primary assessment of individual learning.
  
---
# dapR2: Assessment - Academic Integrity
+ **All assessments are individual assessments**

+ What is acceptable (encouraged):
  + Going over your quizzes together once your marks and feedback have been released
  + Discussing the approach you plan to take to the report
  + Helping one another think through and solve problems (as in the lab)
  + Revising with one another and helping each other produce notes sheets for the exam

--

+ What is not acceptable:
  + Copying code for the report
  + Copying blocks of text for the report
  + Sharing questions and answers on quizzes
  + Cheating in the exam

+ All of the above are examples (not a comprehensive list) of academic misconduct. 
  + We will report cases of misconduct.

--

+ It will contain:
  + Slide decks and links to lecture recordings
  + Links to lab material
  + Links to the weekly quizzes
  + Any comments or specific instructions for the week
  + Links to discussion boards
  + Reading (all freely available on-line)
