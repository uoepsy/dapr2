# Week's Learning Objectives
1. Understand how to interpret significance tests for `\(\beta\)` coefficients.
2. Understand how to calculate the interpret `\(R^2\)` and adjusted- `\(R^2\)` as a measure of model quality.
3. Be able to locate each of these tests in R `lm` model output.

---
# Recap
+ Last week we introduced the general linear model equation:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ And we ran an example concerning test scores:

`$$score_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 hours_{i} + \beta_2 motivation_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ And we looked at how to run this model in R:


```r
lm(score ~ hours + motivation, data = test_study2)
```

---
# Evaluating our model
+ At this point, we have estimated values for the key parameters of our model ( `\(\beta\)`s ).

+ Now we have to think about how we evaluate the model.

+ There are three ways to think about evaluation:

  1. Evaluating the individual coefficients
  2. Evaluating the overall model quality
  3. Evaluating the model assumptions (later in the course)

+ Before accepting a set of results, it is important to consider all three of these aspects of evaluation.

???
Important to really emphasize this is a package of information and we want it all before we decide to accept our model.

---
#  Significance of individual effects 
+ A general way to ask this question would be to state: 

&gt; **Is our model model informative about the relationship between X and Y?**

--

+ In the context of our example from last lecture, we could ask, 

&gt; **Is study time a useful predictor of test score?**

--

+ The above is a research question/hypothesis. As we have done before, we need to turn this into a testable statistical hypothesis.

---
#  Evaluating individual predictors 
+ Steps in hypothesis testing:

--
  + Research questions
    
--
  
  + Statistical hypothesis
    
--
  
  + Define the null
    
--
  
  + Calculate an estimate of effect of interest.
  
--
  
  + Calculate an appropriate test statistic.
    
--
  
  + Evaluate the test statistic against the null.
    

---
# Research question and hypotheses

+ **Research questions** are statements of what we intend to study. 

+ A good question defines:

--

  + Constructs under study
  + the relationship being tested
  + A direction of relationship
  + target populations etc.

&gt; **Does increased study time improve test scores in school age children?**

--

+ **Statistical hypotheses** are testable mathematical statements.

--

  + In typical testing in Psychology, we define have a **null ( `\(H_0\)` )** and an **alternative ( `\(H_1\)` )** hypothesis.
  + `\(H_0\)` is precise, and states a specific value for the effect of interest.
  + `\(H_1\)` is not specific, and simply says "something else other than the null is more likely"


---
# Statistical significance: Overview

+ Remember, we only ever test the null.

+ We select a significance level, `\(\alpha\)` (typically .05)

+ Then we calculate the `\(p\)`-value associated with our test statistic (here `\(\beta\)` )

+ If the associated `\(p\)` is smaller, then we **reject** the null.

+ If it is larger, then we **fail to reject** the null.

# A brief pause

**Any questions before we look at this process in a little more detail**

---
# Defining null

+ Conceptually:
	+ If `\(x\)` yields no information on `\(y\)`, then `\(\beta_1 = 0\)`
	
+ **Why would this be the case?**

--
	+ `\(\beta\)` gives the predicted change in `\(y\)` for a unit change in `\(x\)`.
	+ If `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` are unrelated, then a change in `\(x\)` will not result in any change to the predicted value of `\(y\)`
	+ So for a unit change in `\(x\)`, there is no (=0) change in `\(y\)`.
	
+ We can state this formally as a null and alternative:

`$$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$$`
`$$H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0$$`

???
+ For the null to be testable, we need to formally define it. 
+ Point out here the difference in the specificity of the hypotheses. `\(H_0\)` is that the `\(b_1\)` takes a specific value. `\(H_1\)` is that `\(b_1\)` has some value that is not this specific value. i..e one is directly testable, the other is not.


---
# Point estimate and test statistic

+ We have already seen how we calculate `\(\hat \beta_1\)`.

+ The associated test statistic to for `\(\beta\)` coefficients is a `\(t\)`-statistic

`$$t = \frac{\hat \beta}{SE(\hat \beta)}$$`

+ where

  + `\(\hat \beta\)` = any `\(\beta\)` coefficient we have calculated
  + `\(SE(\hat \beta)\)` = standard error of `\(\beta\)` 

--

+ **Recall** that the standard error describes the spread of the sampling distribution.
  + The standard error (SE) provides a measure of sampling variability
  + Smaller SE's suggest more precise estimate (=good)
  
???
+ brief reminders on test statistics
  + every quantity we wish to calculate a significance test for needs an test statistic.
  + the test statistic is a value that has a known sampling distribution
+ If sampling distribution is unfamiliar, again, recap the hypothesis testing material

# And work out the `\(t\)`-values

+ We can check the value for `motivation` first:

`$$t = \frac{\hat \beta_1}{SE(\hat \beta_1)} = \frac{0.9163}{0.3838} = 2.388 (3dp)$$`

+ Check `hours` in your own time.

+ So we know where the `\(\beta\)` values come from, and we have just seen `\(t\)`, what about the `\(SE\)` and `\(p\)`

---
#  SE( `\(\hat \beta_1\)` )

+ The formula for the standard error of the slope is:

`$$SE(\hat \beta_j) = \sqrt{\frac{ SS_{Residual}/(n-k-1)}{\sum(x_{ij} - \bar{x_{j}})^2(1-R_{xj}^2)}}$$`
+ Where:
	+ `\(SS_{Residual}\)` is the residual sum of squares
	+ `\(n\)` is the sample size
	+ `\(k\)` is the number of predictors
	+ `\(x_{ij}\)` is the observed value of a predictor ( `\(j\)` ) for an individual ( `\(i\)` )
	+ `\(\bar{x_{ij}\)` is the mean of a predictor
	+ `\((1 - R_{xj}^2)\)` is the multiple correlation coefficient of the predictors

+ `\((1 - R_{xj}^2)\)` captures to degree to which all of our predictors are related.
  + For simple linear models, this = 0 as there is only 1 predictor
  
---
# SE( `\(\hat \beta_1\)` )

`$$SE(\hat \beta_j) = \sqrt{\frac{ SS_{Residual}/(n-k-1)}{\sum(x_{ij} - \bar{x_{j}})^2(1-R_{xj}^2)}}$$`  
+ We want our `\(SE\)` to be smaller - this means our estimate is precise

+ Examining the above formula we can see that:
	+ `\(SE\)` is smaller when residual variance ( `\(SS_{residual}\)` ) is smaller
	+ `\(SE\)` is smaller when sample size ( `\(N\)` ) is larger
	+ `\(SE\)` is larger when the number of predictors ( `\(k\)` ) is larger
	+ `\(SE\)` is larger when a predictor is strongly correlated with other predictors ( `\(R_{xj}^2\)` )

+ So all we have left is `\(p\)`

???
+ Well return to this later when we discuss multi-collinearity issues




---
# Sampling distribution for the null

+ Now we have our `\(t\)`-statistic, we need to evaluate it.

+ For that, we need sampling distribution for the null.

+ For `\(\beta\)`, this is a `\(t\)`-distribution with `\(n-k-1\)` degrees of freedom.
	+ Where `\(k\)` is the number of predictors, and the additional -1 represents the intercept.

--

+ So in our example:
  + n = 150
  + k = 2
  + 150 - 2 - 1 = 147

---
#  A decision about the null 
+ So we have a `\(t\)`-value associated with our `\(\beta\)` coefficient.
	+ t = 2.388

+ And we know we will evaluate it against a `\(t\)`-distribution with 147 df.

+ As with all tests we need to set our `\(\alpha\)`.
	+ Let's take 0.05 two tailed.

--

+ Now we need a critical value to compare our observed `\(t\)`-value to.

+ areas
+ % underneath each end
+ comment on how it would be different one tailed
+ remind about what X is, thus where the line is

---
#  Confidence intervals for `\(\beta\)`
+ We can also compute confidence intervals for `\(\hat \beta\)`
+ The `\(100 (1 - \alpha)\)`, e.g., 95%, confidence interval for the slope is:

`$$\hat \beta_1 \pm t^* \times SE(\hat \beta_1)$$`

+ So, 95% confidence interval for in our example for the effect of `motivation` would be:


```r
tibble(
  LowerCI = round(0.91634 - (qt(0.975, 147) * 0.38376), 3),
  UpperCI = round(0.91634 + (qt(0.975, 147)* 0.38376), 3)
)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   LowerCI UpperCI
##     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1   0.158    1.68
```



+ The confidence interval of 0.158 to 1.675 does not include zero, 
  + Therefore, we can conclude that **motivation is a statistically significant predictor of test scores** ( `\(p &lt; .05\)`).

# Time for a break! Questions

#  Quality of the overall model 
+ When we measure an outcome ( `\(y\)` ) in some data, the scores will vary (we hope).
  + Variation in `\(y\)` = total variation of interest.

--

+ The aim of our linear model is to build a model which describes `\(y\)` as a function of `\(x\)`.
	+ That is we are trying to explain variation in `\(y\)` using `\(x\)`.

--

+ But it won't explain it all.
  + What is left unexplained is called the residual variance.

--

+ So we can breakdown variation in our data based on sums of squares as;

`$$SS_{Total} = SS_{Model} + SS_{Residual}$$`

---
#  Coefficient of determination 
+ One way to consider how good our model is, would be to consider the proportion of total variance our model accounts for. 

`$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}$$`

+ `\(R^2\)` = coefficient of determination

--

  + Quantifies the amount of variability in the outcome accounted for by the predictors.
  + More variance accounted for, the better.
  + Represents the extent to which the prediction of `\(y\)` is improved when predictions are based on the linear relation between `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`.

--

+ Let's see how it works.
  + To do so, we need to calculate the different sums of squares.


---
# Total Sum of Squares

.pull-left[
+ Sums of squares quantify difference sources of variation.

`$$SS_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2$$`

+ Squared distance of each data point from the mean of `\(y\)`.

+ Mean is our baseline. 

+ Without any other information, our best guess at the value of `\(y\)` for any person is the mean.

# Values in our sample

  + `\(SS_{total}\)` = 8556.06
  + `\(SS_{residual}\)` = 2826.83
  + `\(SS_{model}\)` = 5729.23

+ In the LEARN folder there is a document which shows the calculations from the raw data


---
#  Coefficient of determination 
+ Now we can finally come back to `\(R^2\)`.

`$$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}$$`

+ Or

`$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}}$$`

+ So in our example:

`$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = \frac{5729.23}{8556.06} = 0.6695$$`

+ ** `\(R^2\)` = 0.6695 means that 66.95% of the variation in test scores is accounted for by hours of revision and student motivation.**

#  Adjusted `\(R^2\)` 
+ We can also compute an adjusted `\(R^2\)` when our `lm` has 2+ predictors.
  + `\(R^2\)` is an inflated estimate of the corresponding population value

+ Due to random sampling fluctuation, even when `\(R^2 = 0\)` in the population, it's value in the sample may `\(\neq 0\)` 

+ In **smaller samples** , the fluctuations from zero will be larger on average

+ With **more IVs** , there are more opportunities to add to the positive fluctuation


`$$\hat R^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2)\frac{N-1}{N-k-1}$$`

+ Adjusted `\(R^2\)` adjusts for both sample size ( `\(N\)` ) and number of predictors ( `\(k\)` )

  2. We are more likely to find a significant effect when we have picked good variables (smaller residual SS) and we have a large sample.
  3. We can assess the degree to which our model explains variance in the outcome based on `\(R^2\)`
  4. When we have multiple predictors, we can use the adjusted `\(R^2\)` to account for the random fluctuations due to the model being more complex.
  
+ Next week we will look at model comparisons and standardization of coefficients.
