#  Binary outcomes 

+ Thus far we have discussed:
	+ linear regression with a continuous DV
	+ linear regression with categorical (including binary) predictors

+ What if we have a binary outcome variable?
	+ E.g.,:
		+ Healthy vs diseased
		+ Died vs survived
		+ Hired vs not hired
		+ Correct vs incorrect

+ When we have binary outcome variable, linear regression is no longer appropriate
	+ Let's see what happens when we fit a linear regression model with a binary outcome variable?


---
#  Applying linear regression to binary outcomes 

+ We can code our outcome in terms of whether or not an event happened
	+ `\(Y=1\)` for a job offer (event occurred)
	+ `\(Y=0\)` for no job offer (event did not occur)
		
+ If we then fit a linear regression model, our model predicts the probability of the event occurring `\(P(Y=1)\)` or `\(P(y_i)\)`


---
#  Some example data 
+ Imagine we're interested in predicting hiring decisions. 

+ We collect data on n=242 job-seekers
	+ Age
	+ Effort put into job application

+ Our variables:
	+ DV: `work` (0 = did not get job; 1 = did get job)
	+ IV1: `age` (in years)
	+ IV2: `msrch` (effort into job application, 0=low effort, 1 = high effort)


---
#  Visualize Our Data 

.pull-left[

+ Here we can see:

1. We have slightly more people being hired than not (light blue bar in left-hand plot)

2. Those who were hired (blue) are younger than those who were not (red) (density plot, top right)

3. There is a greater number of people who work hard (proportion of blue in bottom right plot) among those who were hired (right hand bar of this plot)

#  Linear probability model

#  The problem with linear regression 

+ In general, when we apply linear regression to binary outcomes:
	+ The distribution of the residuals is bimodal (not normal)
	+ The variance of the residuals is not constant
	+ The relation between `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` is not linear
	+ Probabilities are not constrained to be between 0 and 1
	
+ The logistic regression model solves these issues with linear regression

---
class: center, middle

#Let's get some details on the logistic model

---
#  The logistic regression model 
+ In logistic regression, we predict the probability that `\(Y=1\)`, `\(P(y_i)\)`, from our X's, using:

`$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1)}}$$`

+ `\(e\)` = exponential
+ `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1\)` is a linear combination with:
	+ a constant `\(\beta_0\)` (intercept), and
	+ `\(\beta_1\)` capturing the effect of `\(x_1\)` on the outcome `\(y\)`

#  The logistic regression model

---
#  Probability, odds and log-odds
+ An alternative way to think about this is in terms of probability, odds and log-odds.

+ Our presentation above includes the exponential of the coefficients so that (a) predictions are bounded within 0 and 1, and (b) we can have a linear representation.

+ The alternative way to view it is to change what we are predicting...


---
#  Probability, odds and log-odds



.pull-left[

+ `\(Probability = P(Y_i)\)`

+ `\(odds = \frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)}\)`

+ `\(logodds = ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right)\)`

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="MC_logistic.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
#  Logistic models with different slopes 
+ Given that we can see our log-odds provide a linear relation, we can think about predicting these:

`$$ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1$$`
+ and we can easily extend to models with multiple predictors:

`$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 ... + \beta_kx_k)}}$$`

+ Or

`$$ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 ... + \beta_kx_k$$`


---
#  Estimating logistic regression coefficients 
+ Linear regression models can be estimated using least squares estimation

+ Logistic regression models are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

+ MLE  finds the logistic regression coefficients that *maximise the likelihood of the observed data having occurred*
	+ While least squares estimation minimises the SSE to find the coefficients for the line of best, MLE minimises the log-likelihood
	+ Larger log-likelihood values indicate poorer fitting models



---
#  Overall model evaluation 
+ To evaluate overall model fit in logistic regression we:
	+ Compare our model to a baseline model with no predictors (null model)
	+ Assess the improvement in fit
	+ *Note we have already seen this idea when discussing the `\(F\)`-test and incremental `\(F\)`-test*
	
+ The baseline model is where the predicted values for the DV are based on the most frequent value of the DV (0 or 1)
	+ Our best guess of the DV value in the absence of informative predictors.
	+ Analogous to using the mean DV value as the baseline in linear regression.

---
#  Overall model evaluation 
+ We compare our model with the baseline model using **deviance**:

`$$deviance = -2*loglikelihood$$`

+ Deviance often denoted **-2LL**

---
#  Overall model evaluation 
+ We calculate the -2LL differences between our model and the baseline model.

+ We assess the statistical significance of the -2LL difference to see if our model significantly improves on the baseline model
	+ We compare our -2LL difference to a `\(\chi^2\)` distribution with df = k
		+ k= number of predictors in model
		
+ Significant `\(p\)`-value indicates that our model improves on the baseline model.

+ Assessing the -2LL differences in this way is called a likelihood ratio test or chi-square difference test

#Logistic regression in R



---
#  The `glm()` function 
+ In R, we conduct logistic regression using the `glm()` function

+ `glm` stands for **g**eneralised **l**inear **m**odel
  + More on this next week
  
+ Very similar in structure to the `lm()` function


---
#  Run our model: a little more code 


```r
*m2 &lt;- glm(work ~ age + msrch, data = hire,
    family = "binomial")
```

+ `glm()`; R function for running generalised linear models.
	+ Provide a formula in the same style as lm()
	+ Provide the name of the dataset

---
#  Run our model: a little more code 


```r
m2 &lt;- glm(work ~ age + msrch, data = hire, 
*   family = "binomial")
```

+ The new bit.
	+ We need to state what family of probability distributions we want for our DV.
	+ This relates to the type of variable our DV is.
	+ We will take a little more about this next lecture.
	+ For now, for a binary variable, we want `family = binomial`

---
# Quick aside: Why binomial?
+ Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution. (you do not need to remember the probability mass function below - don't worry.)

`$$f(k,n,p) = Pr(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^{k}q^{n-k}$$`

+ `\(k\)` = number of success
+ `\(n\)` = total trials, 
+ `\(p\)` = probability success
+ `\(q\)` = `\(1-p\)` or probability of failure
+ `\(\binom{n}{k}\)` = `\(n\)` choose `\(k\)`, or the number of ways to select `\(k\)` unordered items from a set of `\(n\)` items.

+ Practically, we can think of every instance of a `Hire` in out example as a success, and every `no hire` as a failure.

#  Model equation: job-seeking example 
+ Below we have the general form with two `\(x\)`'s

`$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2)}}$$`

+ And we can insert the values from the previous slide with our model results:


`$$P(y_i) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(4.525 -0.118age + 1.683msrch)}}$$`

---
#  Interpreting logistic model coefficients
+ In linear regression, the `\(b\)` coefficients for each IV are the unit increase in `\(Y\)` for every unit increase in `\(X\)` (holding other IVs constant)

+ In logistic regression, the `\(b\)` coefficients for each IV are the **change in log odds of `\(Y\)` for every unit increase in `\(x\)`** (holding other IVs constant)


---
#  What are log odds? 
`\(b\)` = **the change in log odds of `\(Y\)` for every unit increase in `\(X\)`**

+ The odds of an event occurring (e.g., a job offer; Y=1) is defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring:

`$$odds = \frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)}$$`

+ `\(P(Y=1)\)` is the same as `\(P(y_i)\)` calculated in the logistic regression model
  + Think of a coin toss.
  + Odds of tails occurring = 0.5
  + Odds of not tails = 0.5
  + Odds = 1


---
#  What are log odds?  
`\(b\)` = **the change in log odds of `\(Y\)` for every unit increase in `\(X\)`**

+ Log odds are then the natural logarithm of the odds:


`$$log odds = ln \left (\frac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)} \right)$$`

---
#  Probabilities, odds and log-odds 


```r
tibble(
  Probs = seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1)
) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    Odds = round(Probs/(1-Probs),2),
    Logits = round(log(Odds),2)
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3

---
#  For our job-seekers example 
+ For every additional year of age, there was a decrease in the log odds of a job offer of 0.118

+ Those who showed high effort in their application had a 1.683 greater log odds of a job offer than those who showed low effort

---
#  Odds ratio 
+ Log odds don't provide an easily interpretable way of understanding how the DV changes with the IV's

+ The `\(b\)` coefficients from logistic regression are thus often converted to odds ratios
	+ Odds ratios are a bit easier to interpret
	+ Odds ratios are obtained by exponentiating the `\(b\)` coefficients

+ In R, we exponentiate coefficients using the `exp()` function.

---
#  Exponentiating `\(b\)` coefficients

exp(coef(m2))

##  92.3001400   0.8882662   5.3835809
```


---
#  Interpreting odds ratios  

+ When the coefficients are converted to odds ratios, they represent the **change in odds with a unit increase in X**
	+ Specifically the *ratio of odds* at X=x and X=x+1
	
+ An odds ratio of 1 indicates no effect

+ An odds ratio &lt; 1 indicates a negative effect

+ An odds ratio of &gt;1 indicates a positive effect

```

+ For every year of `age`, the odds of being hired decrease by 0.88.

+ For those who put high effort into applications, the odds of being hired increase by a factor of 5.38.

	+ Smaller (more negative) AIC and BIC indicate better fitting models
	+ BIC, in the context of regression, penalises extra predictors more heavily
	+ BIC differences &gt;10 indicate that one model is better than another to a practically significant extent

#  AIC and BIC in R 


```r
AIC(m_null, m_age, m_full)
```

```
##        df      AIC
## m_null  1 337.2187
## m_age   2 317.9762
## m_full  3 291.3604
```



```r
BIC(m_null, m_age, m_full)
```

```
##        df      BIC
## m_null  1 340.7077
## m_age   2 324.9541
## m_full  3 301.8273

# Summary of logistic regression
+ Use logistic regression for binary data
  +Logistic regression coefficients are converted to  odds ratios to make them more interpretable
	+ Odds ratios tell us how the odds of the event change with a unit increase in X
		+ 1 is no effect
		+ Less than 1 is a negative effect
		+ More than 1 is a positive effect

+ Statistical significance of predictors can be assessed via:
	+ z-test
	+ Confidence intervals
	+ Likelihood ratio test

+ Model selection uses
	+ Likelihood ratio test
	+ AIC and BIC
