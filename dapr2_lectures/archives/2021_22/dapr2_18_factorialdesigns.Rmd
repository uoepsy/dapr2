# Week's Learning Objectives
+ Understand how to interpret simple effects for experimental designs
+ Understadn how to interpret exploratory pairwise analyses for factorial designs
+ Know how to do both analyses using `emmeans()`

---
# Just a little bit more of the hospital example
```{r}
hosp_tbl <- read_csv("hospital.csv", col_types = "dff")
m1 <- lm(SWB ~ Treatment + Hospital + Treatment*Hospital, data = hosp_tbl)
anova(m1)
```

---
# Our results
```{r}
m1sum <- summary(m1)
round(m1sum$coefficients,2)
```

---
# But where do we go next?
+ It is typically a bad idea to focus on main effects in the presence of an interaction.
  + The interaction means the effect of the condition differs dependent on the interacting variable.

+ So we need to understand more about the interaction

+ We will use the `emmeans` package to explore this futher:
  + We will start by looking at the visualizations
  + And then consider the simple effects
  
  
---
# Visualizing the interaction

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width ="80%"}
emmip(m1, Hospital ~ Treatment)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width ="80%"}
emmip(m1, Treatment ~ Hospital)
```

]

---
# Simple Effects
+ We noted previously that simple contrasts/effects consider the effect of one condition at a specific level of the other.
  + Is there an effect of `Hospital` for those receiving `Treatment A`? (and so on for all combinations)
  + Or, put another way, is there a difference in SWB between Hospitals 1 and 2 for people receiving Treatment A

+ We also know an interaction is defined as the change in the effect of one variable given the value of another.
  + So here, value = a specific level.
  + So by considering the simple effects, we can identify at which levels of the interacting condition we see different effects.

---
# Simple Effects with `emmeans`

```{r}
m1_emm <- emmeans(m1, ~Treatment*Hospital)
m1_simple1 <- pairs(m1_emm, simple = "Hospital")
m1_simple1
```

---
# Simple Effects with `emmeans`

```{r}
m1_simple2 <- pairs(m1_emm, simple = "Treatment")
m1_simple2
```


---
# Simple effects with plots

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
emmip(m1, Treatment ~ Hospital)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
m1_simple1
```

]

---
# Simple effects with plots

.pull-left[
```{r}
m1_simple2
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
emmip(m1, Hospital ~ Treatment)
```

]

# Welcome Back!
**One more step in exploration**

---
# Pairwise comparisons
+ So far we have been discussing tests which move from the very general to the specific:
  + Overall model F
  + Incremental F/ F per condition
  + Contrasts and codes
  + Simple effects
  
+ But we have one more layer that more closely aligns to looking at the $\beta$ coefficients, namely a fully exploratory pairwise analysis.

---
# Pairwise comparisons
+ As the name suggests, pairwise comparisons compare all levels of a given predictor variable with all levels of the other.

```{r}
pairs_res <- pairs(m1_emm)
```

---
# Pairwise comparisons

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pairs_res
```



---
# Why do pairwise comparisons?

+ Sometimes we do not have a concrete hypothesis to test.

+ Sometimes we do, but the exploratory analysis is still useful information for the field.

+ Pairwise comparisons throws up a statistical issue, namely the problem of multiple comparisons.
  + When we do lots and lots of tests, the chances of Type I error (false-positives) increase.

+ We will move on to how we can adjust our inferences to deal with this next week, along with a quick revisit of assumption checks.

---
# Summary
+ This week we have looked at:
  + Probing and understanding interactions via simple effects.
  + Estimation of pairwise tests
  + Both of the above using `emmeans()`

+ This completes the new learning related to analysing experimental designs.
