# Weeks Learning Objectives
1. Interpret interactions for between two categorical variables (dummy coding).

2. Visualize and probe interactions.

3. Be able to read interaction plots

# Topics for today

+ Categorical-categorical interaction.
  + Begin with 2x2 (two binary variables)
  + Move on to look at examples with more levels

+ Visualizing and understanding categorical interactions.


---
#  General definition 

+ When the effects of one predictor on the outcome differ across levels of another predictor.

+ Categorical*categorical interaction:
	+ There is a difference in the differences between groups across levels of a second factor.

+ This idea of a difference in differences can be quite tricky to think about.
  + So we will start with some visualization, and then look at two examples.

---
# Visualizing interactions
+ In our class example we have been looking at predicting salary from years of service and department.

+ Suppose our company also had two sites, London and Birmingham, and we wanted to see if the salaries across department differed depending on location.

+ The table below contains the average salary in thousands of pounds for each group.

```{r,, echo=FALSE}
eg1 <- matrix(c(50,40,30,20),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(eg1) <- c("London","Birmingham")
rownames(eg1) <- c("Accounts","Manager")
eg1 <- as.table(eg1)
kable(eg1)
```

---
# Basic plot

.pull-left[
```{r,, echo=FALSE}
dat1 <- tibble(
  location = c("London", "London", "Birmingham", "Birmingham"),
  department = c("Accounts","Manager","Accounts","Manager"),
  salary = c(50, 30, 40, 20)
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(eg1)
```

+ And now let's look at the plot:
  + x-axis shows locations
  + y-axis is our salaries
  + The colours represent departments
  
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
dat1 %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = location, y = salary, group = department, colour = department, shape = department)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(size = 1.5), show.legend = FALSE) +
  ylim(c(0,60))
```

  salary = c(50, 30, 40, 20)
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(eg1)
```

+ In each plot we look at, think about subtracting the average store managers salary (blue triangle) from the average accounts salary (red circle)

+ In both cases, it is £20,000.

+ Note, the lines are parallel
  + Remember what we have said about parallel lines...no interaction

# Extending past 2x2
+ When fitting an interaction to categorical variables with more than 2 levels, we need additional interaction terms.

+ Remember, I categorical variable with 3 levels is represented by 2 dummy coded variables.
  + So that means we have two variables to create products with.

+ The general rule on the number of interaction terms is:

$$(r-1)*(c-1)$$

+ Where 
  + $r$ (row) = number of levels of the first categorical variable.
  + $c$ (column) = number of levels of the first categorical variable.


---
# Example
+ The data comes from a study into patient care in a paediatric wards. 

+ A researcher was interested in whether the subjective well-being of patients differed dependent on the post-operation treatment schedule they were given, and the hospital in which they were staying. 

+ **Condition 1**: `Treatment` (Levels: TreatA, TreatB, TreatC).
  
+ **Condition 2**: `Hosp` (Levels: Hosp1, Hosp2). 
  
+ Total sample n = 180 (30 patients in each of 6 groups).
  + Between person design. 

+ **Outcome**: Subjective well-being (SWB)
  + An average of multiple raters (the patient, a member of their family, and a friend). 
  + SWB score ranged from 0 to 20.

# Brief comment: 3-way interactions

+ **In principle** we can extend interactions to more than two variables.

+ Consider our salary example:
  + We could ask does the change in difference in the effect of years of service across departments, differ dependent on whether you are based in London or Birmingham.
  
+ Note we have three predictors here:
  + Years of service (continuous)
  + department (binary; Store Manager, Accounts)
  + location (binary; London, Birmingham)

+ This is a plausible question concerning organisatonal fairness.

---
# Brief comment: 3-way interactions

+ In general, three-way interactions are tricky to interpret.

+ Require lots of data to test as the effects are often very small.
  + Extends the issues of power already discussed.

+ **Only test a three-way interaction if you have strong theoretical reason for doing so**

---
# Summary
+ We have considered how we fit and interpret linear models with categorical interactions.

+ We have focussed on dummy coded (0,1) variables.

+ Next semester, we will return to this topic and consider other ways of treating categorical data when we have specific hypotheses we want to test.
