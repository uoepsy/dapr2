# Weeks Learning Objectives
1. Interpret the output from a model using dummy coding and sum-to-zero coding

2. Create specific contrast matrices to test specific effects.

3. Recognise other forms of contrasts.

4. Construct models to test factorial designs.

# Topics for today
+ Last time we looked at the $F$-test in one-way designs and linear models

+ This time we are going to consider contrasts and $\beta$ coefficients

---
# Looking beneath the F-test
+ The $F$-test gives us an overall test of the model, or the effect of an experimental condition.

+ But we may want to know something more specific.
  + Differences between specific groups or sets of groups.

+ In such cases we talk about...
  + contrasts & planned comparisons
  + post-hoc test

+ So how do we approach these from the linear model perspective?

---
# Contrasts and Planned comparisons
+ Sometimes we want to make comparisons between pairs of things.
  + Treatment A vs Treatment B
  + Treatment A vs (Treatment B & Treatment C) etc.

+ Such comparisons can be... 
  + Specified a priori (confirmatory)
  + For all possible comparisons (exploratory)
  
+ We achieve these comparisons via assigning weights to groups.

+ May sound complicated, but we have already seen this practice in action this year
  
---
# Dummy coding
+ (Also called reference group coding.) 

+ Create $k$-1 dummy variables/contrasts
  + where $k$ is the number of levels of the categorical predictor. 

+ Assign reference group 0 on all dummies.

+ Assign 1 to the focal group.

+ Enter the dummies into the linear model and they code the difference in means between the focal group/level and the reference.

+ We are going to use $g$ from here on to be explicit these are experimental groups.
  + But if we think in terms of the categorical variables produced by a design $g = k$

---
# Why do we need a reference group?
+ Consider our example.

+ We have three groups each given a specific Treatment A, B or C

+ We want a model that represents our data (observations), but all we "know" are what groups an observation belongs to. So;

$$y_{ij} = \mu_i + \epsilon_{ij}$$

+ Where 
  + $y_{ij}$ are the individual observations
  + $\mu_i$ is the mean of group $i$ and
  + $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the individual deviation from that mean.


???
+ And this hopefully makes sense.
  + Given we know someone's group, our best guess is the mean
  + But people wont all score the mean, so there is some deviation for every person.


---
# Why do we need a reference group?
+ An alternative way to present this idea looks much more like our linear model:

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \underbrace{(\mu_{i} - \beta_0)}_{\beta_i} + \epsilon_{ij}$$
+ Where 
  + $y_{ij}$ are the individual observations
  + $\beta_0$ is an estimate of reference/overall average
  + $\mu_i$ is the mean of group $i$ 
  + $\beta_1$ is the difference between the reference and the mean of group $i$, and
  + $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the individual deviation from that mean.

---
# Why do we need a reference group?
+ We can write this idea equation more generally:

$$\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_i $$

+ or for the specific groups (in our case 3):

$$\mu_{treatmentA} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1A}$$

$$\mu_{treatmentB} = \beta_0 + \beta_{2B}$$

$$\mu_{treatmentC} = \beta_0 + \beta_{3C}$$

+ **The problem**: we have four parameters ( $\beta_0$ , $\beta_{1A}$ , $\beta_{2B}$ , $\beta_{3C}$ ) to model three group means ( $\mu_{TreatmentA}$ , $\mu_{TreatmentB}$ , $\mu_{TreatmentC}$ )
  + This means our model is under-identified.
  + We are trying to estimate too much with too little.

---
# Constraints fix identification
+ Consider dummy coding.

+ Suppose we make Treatment A the reference. Then, 

$$\mu_{treatmentA} = \beta_0$$

$$\mu_{treatmentB} = \beta_0 + \beta_{2B}$$

$$\mu_{treatmentC} = \beta_0 + \beta_{3C}$$
+ Fixed! 

+ We now only have three parameters ( $\beta_0$ , $\beta_{2B}$ , $\beta_{3C}$ ) for the three group means ( $\mu_{TreatmentA}$ , $\mu_{TreatmentB}$ , $\mu_{TreatmentC}$ ). 

---
# Why not always use dummy coding?

+ We might not always want to compare against a reference group.

+ We might want to compare to:
  + The overall or grand mean
  + Group 1 vs groups 2, 3, 4 combined
  + and on we go!

+ Let's consider the example of the grand mean... 

---
# Sum to zero constraint

+ With dummy coding we had a reference group, and the mean of that group was equal to the value of $\beta_0$, or 

$$\mu_{reference} = \beta_0$$ 

+ Alternately, we can apply what is referred to as the sum to zero constraint (again using example of three levels).

$$\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 = 0$$

+ There are two consequences of this constraint (see practical exercises for full explanation):

$$\beta_0 = \frac{\mu_1 + \mu_2 + \mu_3}{3}$$

+ And

$$\mu_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$

$$\mu_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_2$$

$$\mu_3 = \beta_0 - (\beta_1 + \beta_2)$$

class: center, middle
# Welcome Back!

---
# OK, but how do we apply the constraint?

+ Answer, in the same way as we did with dummy coding.

+ We can create a set of sum to zero (sometimes called effect, or deviation) variables
  + Or the equivalent contrast matrix.
  
+ For effect code variables we:
  + Create $g-1$ variables
  + For observations in the focal group, assign 1
  + For observations in the last group, assign -1
  + For all other groups assign 0

# Sum to zero/effects for group means

$$\mu_1 = \beta_0 + 1*\beta_1 + 0*\beta_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$

$$\mu_2 = \beta_0 + 0*\beta_1 + 1*\beta_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_2$$

$$\mu_3 = \beta_0 -1*\beta_1 -1*\beta_2 = \beta_0 - \beta_1 -\beta_2$$

+ Now we will look practically at the implementation and differences

# The data

# Group Means

```{r}
hosp_tbl %>%
  select(1:2) %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = round(mean(SWB),3),

    N = n()

# Dummy (reference) model

.pull-left[

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dres <- summary(lm(SWB ~ Treatment, data = hosp_tbl))
round(dres$coefficients[,1],3)

+ Recall the equations for the group means:

$$\mu_{treatmentA} = \beta_0$$
$$\mu_{treatmentB} = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$ 

$$\mu_{treatmentC} = \beta_0 + \beta_2$$

# Effects (sum to zero) model

contrasts(hosp_tbl$Treatment) <- contr.sum 
contrasts(hosp_tbl$Treatment)

$$\beta_0 = \frac{\mu_1 + \mu_2 + \mu_3}{3}$$

$$\mu_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$

$$\mu_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_2$$

# Manual contrast testing
+ We can structure a wide variety of contrasts so long as they can be written

1. A as a linear combination of population means
2. The associated coefficients sum to zero

+ So

$$H_0: c_1\mu_1 + c_1\mu_2 + c_3\mu_3 $$

+ With

$$c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0$$

---
# Manual contrast testing
+ For example, say we wanted to compare TreatmentA to TreatmentB and TreatmentC combined.

+ Our null becomes:

$$H_0: \mu_{treatmentA} = \frac{1}{2}(\mu_{treatmentB} + \mu_{treatmentC})$$

+ Or, is the average SWB of TreatmentA group equal to the average SWB of the combined TreatmentB and TreatmentC

+ We can set the contrasts here:
  + $c_1 = 1$
  + $c_2 = -1/2$
  + $c_3 = -1/2$
  
  
---
# The wide world of contrasts 
+ We have now seen two examples of coding schemes (dummy and effect).

+ We have also seen that so long as we apply some set of constraints, we are able to do different things.

+ This means there are **lots** of different coding's we can use for categorical variables to make different comparisons.
  + If you are interested, see the excellent resource on [UCLA website](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/)

+ These can include some custom contrasts (planned comparisons).
  + Next lecture.

# Summary of today

+ We have considered different ways in which we can code categorical predictors.

+ Take home:
  + Use of coding matrices allows us to compare groups (or levels) in lots of ways.
  + Our $\beta$'s will represent differences in group means.
  + The scheme we use determines which groups.
  + This makes it very flexible for testing hypotheses.
  + We will come to see this is very useful for testing specific hypotheses.
  + Effects (sum to zero, or deviation) coding = traditional ANOVA
