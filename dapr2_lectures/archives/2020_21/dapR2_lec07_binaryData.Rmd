```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

set.seed(1512)
df <- tibble(
  Y = c(round(rnorm(75, 115, 10),0), round(rnorm(75, 90, 50),0)),
  X = c(rep(0, 75), rep(1, 75))
)

write_csv(df, "./week4.csv")
```

## Read in the data
This is going to be specific to your machine and the location of the file, so we will jump over this here. On our case, the data set is called `df`.

## Take a look at the data
Although this wasn't on the to-do list, it is always sensible to view your data. We will use `slice` to look a the first 10 rows:

```{r}
slice(df, 1:10)
```

We can also get the group descriptive statistics:

```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(X) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean = mean(Y),
    SD = sd(Y)
  )
```


## Run linear model

```{r}
m1 <- lm(Y ~ X, data = df)
summary(m1)
```


## Run t-test

```{r}
m2 <- t.test(Y~X, data = df)
m2
```
