# Question 1

Below are a set of calls in R that will run t-tests for all 15 pairwise group comparisons from the hospital.csv data. Try running them and compare the results of using a Bonferonni corrected alpha with using a TukeyHSD correction (you can get those results from the lecture slides or try running them yourself). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tA1_A2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Hospital, data = filter(hosp_tbl, (Treatment == "TreatA")))
tA1_B1 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp1"))))
tA1_C1 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp1"))))
tA1_B2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
tA1_C2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
tA2_B1 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp2") | (Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp1"))))
tA2_C1 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp2") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp1"))))
tA2_B2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp2") | (Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
tA2_C2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatA" & Hospital == "Hosp2") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
tB1_C1 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp1"))))
tB1_B2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Hospital, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
tB1_C2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
tB2_C1 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp2") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp1"))))
tB2_C2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Treatment, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatB" & Hospital == "Hosp2") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
tC1_C2 <- t.test(SWB ~ Hospital, data = filter(hosp_tbl, ((Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp1") | (Treatment == "TreatC" & Hospital == "Hosp2"))))
```

Remember, you can find the data at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/hospital.csv

The Bonferroni corrected alpha is 0.05/15 = 0.003, so you must compare each of the p values from your t-tests with that alpha.
