#  Todays lecture 

+ What happens after we have found a good factor solution?
+ Next 3 lectures we will talk about:
	+ Replicating factor solutions
		+ Congruence and **confirmatory** factor analysis.
	+ Using the results for further analyses
		+ Factor scores and structural equation modelling
	+ Reliability
	+ Validity

---
#  Congruence coefficients 

+ Often we are interested in whether a particular factor solution replicates in a new sample.
	+ Imagine we develop a new test.
	+ We confirm the hypothesized structure in an initial sample.
	+ But we then gather a second large random sample.
	+ It would be good news for our measure if our factor structure replicated consistently in this sample.
+ There are a number of ways we can assess consistency.
+ One of the most common and simplest methods is the use of congruence coefficients.

---
#  Congruence coefficients 

+ Congruence coefficients, or Tucker’s Congruence Coefficients, are essentially the correlations between vectors of factor loadings across samples.

---
#  Congruence coefficients 

+ To calculate congruence:
	+ Run the factor model in sample 1.
	+ Run the factor model in sample 2
		+ Ensuring the same items are included, same number of factors specified etc.
	+ Calculate congruence (very simple in R).

---
#  Congruence coefficients 

+ Lorenzo- Seva  & ten Berge (2006) discuss nice properties of the Tucker coefficient:
	+ It measures similarity independent of the mean size of the loadings.
	+ It is insensitive to a change in the sign of any pair of loadings.
+ MacCallum  et al. (1999) suggest the following criteria following Tucker :
	+ < 0.68 = terrible
	+ 0.68 to 0.82 = poor
	+ 0.82 to 0.92 = borderline
	+ 0.92 to 0.98 = good
	+ 0.98 to 1.00 = excellent

---
#  Congruence coefficients 

+ We can also use congruence for things like:
	+ Checking consistency across estimation methods
	+ Checking consistency across rotation methods
		+ Particular orthogonal and oblique…
		+ How much does my pattern of factor loadings change when I force them to be orthogonal?
			+ Can contribute to discussion on whether orthogonal rotation is reasonable.

---
#  Confirmatory vs. Exploratory FA 

+ In EFA, all items have loadings on all factors, and these values are purely data driven.
+ However, if we have an idea about which items should group together, we may want to explicitly test this.
	+ This is the idea behind confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
+ In CFA, we specify a model, and test how well it fits the data, rather than letting the data tell us about the model.

#  Confirmatory factor analysis 

+ We can use CFA for reproducibility of a solution in a number of ways:
	+ We can test the results of an EFA in a second sample with CFA.
		+ We include only primary loadings from the EFA.
	+ We can fit a CFA model simultaneously in two samples and use statistical tests of the equivalence of factor loadings (and other parameters).
		+ Called invariance testing.
+ All of these approaches are very strict tests of reproducibility.
	+ We will not cover these in detail, but it is good to know they exist.

---
#  Factor Scores 

+ Sometimes an EFA is the end in and of itself.
	+ Our research question may have concerned the structure of a set of items. 
+ But sometimes we are conducting EFA to identify a set of factors to use in subsequent analyses.
+ If this is our aim, we need to produce a score for these factors .
	+ A value for each individual which represents their standing on the identified factor.


---
#  Calculating factor scores: Unit weighting 

+ Sum raw scores on the observed variables which have primary loadings on each factor.
+ Which to sum is a matter of choosing the cut off for the loading.
+ Simple scoring, but does not recognise the fact that factors are more strongly related to certain items (e.g. bigger factor loadings).


---
#  Calculating factor scores: Regression method & Bartlett 

+ Sometimes also called;
	+ Thurstone  Method, Thompson Method
+ Ordinary least squares (OLS) approach to computing scores from the observed item correlations, and the correlations between items and factors (loadings ).
+ Bartlett:
	+ This method focusses on minimizing the sums of squares for the unique factors.


---
#  Calculating factor scores: Anderson-Rubin & Ten Berge 

+ A negative consequence of the regression method is it can produce scores which correlate when factors were orthogonal.
+ Anderson-Rubin:
	+ The Anderson-Rubin alternative preserves orthogonality of scores.
+ Ten Berge:
	+ Generalizes the Anderson-Rubin method to preserve the correlations (of lack thereof) between factors.


---
#  Choice of factor score… 

+ Simple sum scores, strictly speaking, require very strict properties in the data.
	+ These are rarely tested, and do not often hold.
+ Given a desire to use factor scores for subsequent models, where the correlations between the scores may be important, ten Berge scores are preferable.
+ However, use of any scores comes with cautions…

---
#  Factor score indeterminacy 

+ Factor indeterminacy concerns the fact that there are a greater number of common and unique factors in the factor model than there are observed variables .
+ In the same way as we have an infinite number of rotated locations for the factor axes, we have an infinite number of possible scores for individuals on the common factors which would be consistent with the same set of factor loadings.

---
#  EFA vs PCA and Indeterminacy 

+ A very important point is the distinction here with PCA.
+ Factor score indeterminacy is only a problem in factor analysis.
+ PCA scores are not indeterminate because we do not estimate unique variances.
	+ Remember for PCA all variance is common!
	+ Therefore , PCA scores are determinate.

#  Another solution… 

+ Another solution if you want to use your factors to, for example, predict other variables, is to use **structural equation modelling (SEM).**
+ Basic principle:
	+ Have a model which includes latent variables and the relations between them.
	+ Measurement model: A factor model relating items to factors.
	+ Structural model: With the relations between factors.
