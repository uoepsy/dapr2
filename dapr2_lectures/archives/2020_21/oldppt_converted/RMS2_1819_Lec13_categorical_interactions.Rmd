#  Today’s lecture 

+ This week, the focus is on categorical*categorical interactions in linear models (regression).
	+ Today we will discuss dummy codes
	+ Tomorrow we will discuss effects codes
+ Some of you may already be thinking how this relates to interactions in ANOVA designs.
	+ Short answer, they are very similar.
	+ Longer answer will take the next two lectures (& lec.17).
+ So let’s get going with dummy codes.

---
#  Things to remember…. 

+ We have discussed that a simple regression with a single binary predictor = t-test
	+ So we now we can use linear models for tests of means.
	+ When we do so, our coefficients concern differences in group means.
+ We know from last week that when we have an interaction, we are looking at whether an effect changes dependent on the value of the interacting variable.
+ If both variables are categorical, then the interaction is asking:

*Is the difference in the group means* *across levels of* ** *variable 1, different dependent on the level (group) of variable 2.*

---
#  Example 

+ I am investigating whether exposure to natural light in working environments increases productivity and whether the effect of light differs based on task.
	+ Factor A: Low light versus high light
	+ Factor B: Writing versus Calculation
+ Here, the interaction of those variables would be:

*Does the effect of light level on productivity differ dependent on whether someone is completing a writing versus calculation task.*

---
#  Example: Dummy Coding 

+ To dummy code a model with multiple categorical variables (and interactions) we need to code for:
	+ Every level of factor 1
	+ Every level of factor 2
	+ Every combination of levels for the interaction
+ So we need:
	+ (r-1) dummies for factor 1
	+ (c-1) dummies for factor 2
	+ (r-1)(c-1) dummies for the interactions
+ Why have I used r and c here?

#  Interpretation 

+ b 1 = testing the difference in means between High and low light in the Writing condition.
+ b 2 = testing the difference in means between Writing and Calculation in the low light condition.
	+ Note: b1 and b2 are conditional – at specific values of the other categorical predictor.
+ b 3 = testing whether the difference in means between High vs Low light is different for Writing vs Calculation.
	+ Let’s look at the table and results again to make sense of this.

#  Interpretation 

+ As the number of levels of the categorical variables get bigger, not much changes with respect to dummy codes.
	+ We have additional dummies for factors and the interactions.
	+ But we still express the means by parameters and solve in the same way.
	+ We still refer back to the reference group.
	+ For interactions we need to think about which 4 cells we are testing the difference between.

---
#  Running models in R 

+ Very little of this lecture has looked at R-code, and that is because there is no new code here.
+ All we need to make sure of is that:
	+ All categorical variables are recognised as factors.
	+ We have variables dummy coded.
	+ An appropriate group is the reference group for **both** variables (0-0 is now intercept).
+ Then our model is simply (using the class example):

lm(Score ~ Light + Type + Light*Type, data = ex)
