#  Today’s lecture 

+ This week, the focus is on categorical*categorical interactions in linear models (regression).
	+ Today we will discuss dummy codes
	+ Tomorrow we will discuss effects codes
+ Some of you may already be thinking how this relates to interactions in ANOVA designs.
	+ Short answer, they are very similar.
	+ Longer answer will take the next two lectures (& lec.17).
+ So to effects codes.

---
#  Things to remember… 

+ Yesterday our tests (null hypotheses), concerned whether specific cells differed from the reference cell.
+ And we defined the interaction for categorical variables with dummy coding as a difference in the difference between cell means.
+ Recall that in effects coding, intercept (or reference) the average across levels.
+ So extending this logic, our tests (nulls) and interpretations of interactions with effects codes concern averages across cells.

---
#  Classification table for means 

+ Last lecture we were concerned with these cell means and the differences between them.

#  Hypotheses and Nulls 

+ In two-way analysis with effects codes, we have three hypotheses:
	+ Concerning the factor defining the rows
	+ Concerning the factor defining the columns
	+ Concerning the interaction
+ We can express these in terms of the marginal means.
	+ And here we may start to see things looking like ANOVA again.

---
#  Hypotheses and Nulls 

+ We can express these in terms of the marginal means.
	+ Concerning the factor defining the rows
+ No difference in score across levels of row factor
	+ Concerning the factor defining the columns
	+ Concerning the interaction

#  Example 

+ Same example as yesterday.
+ I am investigating whether exposure to natural light in working environments increases productivity and whether the effect of light differs based on task.
	+ Factor A: Low light versus high light
	+ Factor B: Writing versus Calculation
+ We have 20 people per condition.

---
#  Example: Effects Coding 

+ As before, we have (r-1) for rows, (c-1) for columns effect coded variables following:
+ There are (r-1)(c-1) interaction terms as the pairwise products of the above.

#  Extending from a 2x2 

+ We have looked at 2x2 examples for dummy and effects coding.
	+ Full worked examples of 3x3 designs are up on LEARN.
	+ **You need to read these documents for examples of interpretation and the null hypotheses being tested.**
+ But what is the major difference as we extend the number of levels?
+ In short nothing.
	+ All we are doing is identifying pairs of levels that we are comparing, and following the same steps we have here.

---
#  Running models in R 

+ Very little of this lecture has looked at R-code, and that is because there is no new code here.
+ All we need to make sure of is that:
	+ All categorical variables are recognised as factors.
	+ We have variables effects coded.
	+ An appropriate group is the reference group for **both** variables (there will be no interaction for reference levels).
+ Then our model is simply (using the class example):

lm(Score ~ Light + Type + Light*Type, data = ex)

---
#  Tasks for this week… 

+ **Problem** **set 7:** Understanding categorical*categorical interactions
+ **Lab 7:** Understanding categorical*categorical interactions
+ **Reading** **:** See LEARN
+ **Homework** **:** Cont * cont and cont *cat interactions
	+ Open now, closes 17:00 Sunday.
