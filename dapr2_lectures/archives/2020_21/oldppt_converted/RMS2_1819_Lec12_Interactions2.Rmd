#  Today… 

+ Specifically, defining, estimating and interpreting:
	+ Continuous*categorical interactions
	+ **Continuous*continuous interactions**
+ Discuss the important issue of variable centering in interactions.
+ Probing, plotting and evaluating interactions.
+ Discuss the different types of interaction.

---
#  General definition 

+ When the effects of one predictor on the DV differ across levels of another predictor.
+ Continuous*continuous interaction **(referred to as moderation** ):
	+ The slope of the regression line between a continuous predictor and the DV changes as the values of a second continuous predictor change.
+ Note interactions are symmetrical. We can talk about interaction of X with Z, or Z with X.

---
#  Lecture notation 

+ Lecture notation:
+ Y is a continuous outcome
+ X is a continuous predictor
+ Z is a continuous predictor
+ XZ is their product or interaction predictor

---
#  Interpretation: Continuous*Continuous 

+ Lecture notation:
+ = Value of Y when X and Z are 0
+ = Effect of X (slope) when Z = 0
+ = Effect of Z (slope) when X = 0
+  = Change in slope of X on Y across values of Z (and vice versa).
	+ Or how the effect of X depends on Z (and vice versa)

---
#  Interpretation: Continuous*Continuous 

+ Lecture notation:
+ Note, and are referred to as conditional effects, **not as main effects** .
	+ They are the effects at the value 0 of the interacting variable.
	+ Main effects are typically assumed to be constant.
	+ For any beta associated with a variable **not** included in the interaction, interpretation does not change.

---
#  Example: Continuous*Continuous 

+ Conducting a study on how years of service and employee performance ratings predicts salary in a sample of managers.
+ Y = Salary (unit = thousands of pounds ).
+ X = Years of service.
+ Z = Average performance ratings.
	+ Standardized score with a mean of 0.
	+ “Average” performance = 0.
	+ Thus, this variable is already mean centered

#  Example: Continuous*Continuous 

+ General comments:
	+ The coefficients for service and the interaction are significant at nominal alpha = 0.05.
	+ R-squared suggests we have a good model
		+ Explains 86.74% variance.
	+ Our adjusted R-squared says the model would generalize well.
		+ Difference in R-squared to adjusted is small (0.42%)

---
#  Example: Continuous*Continuous 

+ Intercept = 71.20 (2dp):
	+ For managers with 0 years of service and average performance (perf=0), salary is £71,204.
+ Serv (b1) = 1.84 (2dp):
	+ Service slope when performance = 0.
	+ For a manager with average performance, for every year of service, salary increases by ~£1840.
![](assets/img/image5.png)

---
#  Example: Continuous*Continuous 

+ perf (b2) = 4.43 (2dp):
	+ Performance slope when service = 0.
	+ For a manager with 0 years of service, for each standard deviation increase in performance, salary increases by ~£4430.
+ Serv:perf (b3) = 5.49 (2dp):
	+ For every standard deviation increase in performance, the relation of service on salary changes by 5.49.
	+ That is, as performance improves, years of service becomes a stronger positive predictor of salary.

#  Plotting interactions 

+ Simple slopes: *Regression of the outcome Y on a predictor X at specific values of an interacting variable Z.*
+ Recall the simple slopes and intercepts equation:
+ Where;
	+ captures the simple slope of Y on X and is dependent on the value of Z.
+ So all we need to do is select values of Z, or in our case, performance.
	+ This was easy when Z was binary (or categorical), we have a line for each group.
	+ Now we must select reasonable values.
	+ Norm is to take +/- 1SD and the mean value of Z.

---
#  Simple slope calculations 

+ Remember that:
	+ Z here = performance
	+ Performance is a standardized score so SD = 1
+ We want to plot values for performance (Z) of -1, 0 and 1:

#  Centering Years of Service 

+ Our performance variable was a standardized score (z-score).
	+ This means that it is already mean centered .
+ Service was not.
	+ So here, 0 means no years of service.
	+ Not very intuitive given our research context.
+ So let’s look at our coefficients if we also mean center years of service.
	+ Our the “0-0” point is now a manager with average years of service and average performance ratings.

)

#  Probing interactions 

+ Our main regression model provides an omnibus test of the interaction effect.
+ But there may be specific hypotheses/questions we may have about our simple slopes.
+ As such, we may want a way to test the significance of the slopes fo r specific values of the interacting variable.
	+ Commonly people test simple slopes and the mean, +1 and -1 standard deviation from the mean.

#  Probing interactions 

+ Note that our simple slopes analysis requires us to “pick-a-point” of Z at which we test the slope.
	+ Sometimes, we may not have a particular reason to choose any particular value.
	+ That has led to a default being to choose the mean of Z, and +1 and -1 standard deviation from the mean (i.e. low-average-high).
	+ If we do not know what values to choose, we may want a more general approach.
+ Cue regions of significance.
	+ Region of significance analysis identifies the thresholds (values of Z) at which the regression of Y on X changes from non-significance to significance.

#  Types of interaction 

+ Ordinal:
	+ Lines do not cross within the plausible range of measurement of X.
	+ Rank order of one predictor is maintained across levels of another.
	+ More common in observational studies.
+ Disordinal :
	+ Line cross within the plausible range of measurement of x.
	+ Rank order of one predictor is not maintained across levels of another.
	+ More common in experimental work.

---
#  Locating a crossing point 

+ For X (service), the cross point is:
+ For Z (performance), the cross point is :
+ In both cases it is clear that the cross point is dependent on the relative magnitudes of the first-order effect to the high-order (interaction) effect.

#  Higher order terms (Non-linear effects) 

+ The interaction equation:
+ We have noted for a continuous*continuous interaction this is a non-linear effect.
+ We have spoken about non-linearity in the context of model assumptions.
	+ Does this mean we can have other non-linear effects?
	+ Yes….and it looks a lot like an interaction.
+ The equation with a non-linear term for X:

---
#  How do we know to include non-linear? 

+ Theory
	+ Power for non-linear (higher order, interaction) effects is usually low (see final slides).
	+ This, and other features of data (e.g. skew), can lead to spurious interactions.
	+ So the best plan is not to go looking for them unless there is solid theory. But…
+ Sometimes data speaks up and let’s us know something may be misspecified in our models.
	+ E.g. evidence for non-linearity in our assumption checks.
	+ Inclusion of higher-order/interaction terms can help resolve issues with violated model assumptions (linearity & heteroscedasticity).

#  Power and interactions 

+ Statistical power for identifying interactions is generally low.
+ This means that both Type I and Type II error rates are increased.
	+ We may fail to reject the null when we should.
	+ We may reject the null when we should not.
+ With low power there is also a tendency for effects to be over estimated.
+ What does all this mean?
	+ If you identify an interaction in an observational study with low N, be **very** cautious in your interpretation.
	+ What is low N?
		+ Think of a number….
		+ ….bigger than that!
		+ We will talk more about this in the last week.
