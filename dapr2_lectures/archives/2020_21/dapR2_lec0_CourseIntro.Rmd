# In this intro...
+ The dapR team

--

+ dapR and your degree
  + Plus a few course details

--

+ Expectations

--

+ What each week will look like.


---
# dapR Team
+ Tom Booth 
+ Alex Doumas (CO)
+ Jo King
+ Umberto Noe
+ Aja Murray
+ Wonderful tutors (lots)


---
# Where does dapR2 fit?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/timeline1.png")
```



---
# dapR 2 
+ In dapR2, we will teach you how to...

--

  + Deal with data in R, tidy it, describe it and visualize it

--

  + Run, interpret and use linear models for observational designs
  
--

  + Run, interpret and use linear models for experimental designs


---
# What is R? 
+ A very flexible, very cool, programming language for all things data.
  + It does pretty much any statistical method you can think of. (Cool? I think so)
  + But it does a lot more.

+ We will also continue to teach you Rmarkdown 
  + this is a cool way to integrate text and analysis
  + and to write reproducible documents and analyses

---
# What is R? 
+ Open source (free) software for all things data.

+ Huge community worldwide which means lots of free resources in addition to your course materials

--

+ Some examples:
  + [interactive plots](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html) 
  + [interactive dashboards](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/086-bus-dashboard/) 
  + Documents with automatically include results from analysis
  + [books](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/)
  + [websites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
  + Presentations (like the one you are looking at)

# dapR 2: Structure
+ We are on-line, so this will look a little different to normal.

--

+ **Lectures**
  + Equivalent of ~2hr of live lecture, broken into shorter chunks
  + The chunks will be linked with tasks.

--

+ **Independent study labs**
  + Structured reading and exercises with R
  + Equivalent of ~2-3 hrs per week

--

+ **Supported by**
  + "In person" on-line office hours (see LEARN for times)
  + Discussion boards (monitored daily)
  + Lecturer OH (see LEARN for times)

---
# dapR 2: Structure cont.

+ **Live coding**
  + We will try and have a number of synchronous live coding examples
  + These will be run through of types of analysis
  + Sometimes reproducing papers
  + Will be recorded, so if there are any issues with live sessions, they are accessible.


--

+ **Reading**
  + All reading is from free to access sources.
  + You do not need to buy a book and should be able to access everything electronically.


???
+ Requires you to work steadily and consistently across the year. 
+ It builds, and it is hard to cram.
+ To help you build this study skills, course has a specific assessment structure.


---
# dapR 2: Assessment 
+ **Weekly quizzes** (10%)
  + 20 quizzes in total 
  + Quizzes 1 and 2 are practices.
  + The rest comprise your grade.
  + Mark is the average of your best 14/18 scores.

--

+ **Coursework report** (2x 45%%)
  + One per semester
  + Provided a dataset and some questions
  + Task is to construct models to answer the questions, describe them, run them, report the results.
  
--

+ The reports will have some components that are difficult, and will require independent work.

???
Key point to make is the little and often principle


---
# Materials
+ All of your materials for each week will be within the weekly folders on LEARN.

--

+ It will contain:
  + A playlist of recordings
  + Slide decks
  + Links to lab material
  + Links to the weekly quizzes
  + Any comments or specific instructions for the week
  + Links to discussion boards
  + Reading (all freely available online)

--

+ The weekly folders will become available incrementally.


---
# What you can expect from us
1. We will work hard to help you learn.

2. We will be open and communicate with you.

3. We will be polite, respectful and treat you like adults.


---
# What we expect of you
1. You work hard.

2. That you talk to me and the teaching team.

3. That you are polite, and respect the teaching team and your classmates.

4. Try and have fun.

---
# A brief word on engagement
+ It is going to be a different year for everyone

--

+ We are very keen to make sure everyone succeeds. 

--

+ To do that, we need to know when people are struggling. 

--

+ We will keep an eye on this in a number of ways:
  + Presence in OH
  + Engagement with material (watching recordings, discussion boards etc.)
  + Weekly quiz performance.
