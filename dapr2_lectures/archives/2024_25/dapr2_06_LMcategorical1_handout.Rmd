# Warning!
+ From a practical perspective, what we have covered in the lecture is what you need to know.

+ However, to understand how some of the other coding schemes work, there are a couple of technical bits you may find useful to consider.

# Why do we need a reference group?

.pull-left[

+ Consider our example and dummy coding.

+ Our `method` variable has three groups/levels (`read`, `self-test` & `summarise` )

+ We want a model that represents our data (observations), but all we "know" is what group an observation belongs to. So;

$$y_{ij} = \mu_j + \epsilon_{ij}$$

+ Where 
  + $y_{ij}$ are the individual observations
  + $\mu_j$ is the mean of group $j$ and
  + $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the individual deviation from that mean.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F}
 test_study3 %>%
   dplyr::select(ID,score,method) %>%
   slice(1:10)
```

]

???
+ And this hopefully makes sense.
  + Given we know someone's group, our best guess is the mean
  + But people wont all score the mean, so there is some deviation for every person.


---
# Why do we need a reference group?
+ An alternative way to present this idea looks much more like our linear model:

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \underbrace{(\mu_{j} - \beta_0)}_{\beta_j} + \epsilon_{ij}$$
+ Where 
  + $y_{ij}$ are the individual observations
  + $\beta_0$ is an estimate of reference/overall average
  + $\mu_j$ is the mean of group $j$ 
  + $\beta_j$ is the difference between the reference and the mean of group $j$, and
  + $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the individual deviation from that mean.

---
# Why do we need a reference group?
+ We can write this equation more generally as:

$$\mu_j = \beta_0 + \beta_j $$

+ or for the specific groups (in our case 3):

$$\mu_{read} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1read}$$

$$\mu_{self-test} = \beta_0 + \beta_{2self-test}$$

$$\mu_{summarise} = \beta_0 + \beta_{3summarise}$$

+ **The problem**: we have four parameters ( $\beta_0$ , $\beta_{1read}$ , $\beta_{2self-test}$ , $\beta_{3summarise}$ ) to model three group means ( $\mu_{read}$ , $\mu_{self-test}$ , $\mu_{summarise}$ )

+ We are trying to estimate too much with too little.
    + We need to estimate at least 1 parameter less

---
# Constraints fix identification
+ Let's think again about dummy coding.

+ Suppose we make `read` the reference. Then, 

$$\mu_{read} = \beta_0$$

$$\mu_{self-test} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1self-test}$$

$$\mu_{summarise} = \beta_0 + \beta_{summarise}$$
+ **Fixed** ! 

+ We now only have three parameters ( $\beta_0$ , $\beta_{self-test}$ , $\beta_{summarise}$ ) for the three group means ( $\mu_{read}$ , $\mu_{self-test}$ , $\mu_{summarise}$ ). 


> So when we code categorical variables, we need a constraint so that we can estimate our models.
