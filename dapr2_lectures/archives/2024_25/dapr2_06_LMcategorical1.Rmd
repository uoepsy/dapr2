# Part 1: Categorical variables

---
#  Categorical variables (recap dapR1) 
+ Categorical variables can only take discrete values
	+ E.g., animal type: 1= duck, 2= cow, 3= wasp

+ They are mutually exclusive
  + No duck-wasps or cow-ducks!

+ In R, categorical variables should be of class `factor`
  + The discrete values are `levels`
  + Levels can have numeric values (1, 2 3) and labels (e.g. "duck", "cow", "wasp")
  + All that these numbers represent is category membership.

---
# Understanding category membership
+ When we have looked at variables like hours of study, an additional unit (1 hour) is more time.
  + As values change (and they do not need to change by whole hours), we get a sense of more or less time being spent studying
  + Across our whole sample, that gives us variation in hours of study.

+ When we have a categorical variable, we do not have this level of precision.

+ Suppose we split hours of study into the following groups:
  + 0 to 2.99 hours = low study time
  + 3 - 9.99 hours = medium study time
  + 10+ hours = high study time
  
+ **Side note**: This is for point of demonstration, it is never a good idea to break a continuous measure into groups

# Binary variable (recap)
+ Binary variable is a categorical variable with two levels.

+ Traditionally coded with a 0 and 1

+ In `lm`, binary variables are often referred to as dummy variables
  + when we use multiple dummies, we talk about the general procedure of dummy coding

+ Why 0 and 1?

#  Equations for each group 
+ What would our linear model look like if we added the values for $x$.


$$\widehat{score} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 study$$


+ For those who study alone ( $study = 0$ ):


$$\widehat{score}_{alone} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \times 0$$


+ So;


$$\widehat{score}_{alone} = \hat \beta_0$$



---
#  Equations for each group 
+ For those who study with others ( $study = 1$ ):


$$\widehat{score}_{others} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \times 1$$


+ So;


$$\widehat{score}_{others} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1$$


+ And if we re-arrange;


$$\hat \beta_1 = \widehat{score}_{others} - \hat \beta_0$$


+ Remembering that $\widehat{score}_{alone} = \hat \beta_0$, we finally obtain:

$$\hat \beta_1 = \widehat{score}_{others} - \widehat{score}_{alone}$$

# Part 4: Categorical variables with >2 levels


---
#  Including categorical predictors with >2 levels in a regression 
  + The goal when analyzing categorical data with 2 or more levels is that each of our $\beta$ coefficients represents a specific difference between means.

  + e.g. When using a single binary predictor, $\beta_1$ is the difference between the two groups. 


+  To be able to do this when we have 2+ levels, we need to apply a **coding scheme**. 

+ Two common coding schemes are:
  + Dummy coding (which we will discuss now)
  + Effects coding (or sum to zero, which we will discuss next week)
  + There are LOTS of ways to do this; if curious, [see here](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/)

---
#  Dummy coding 
+ Dummy coding uses 0's and 1's to represent group membership
	+ One level is chosen as a baseline
	+ All other levels are compared against that baseline
	
+ Notice, this is identical to binary variables already discussed.

+ Dummy coding is simply the process of producing a set of binary coded variables

+ For any categorical variable, we will create $k$-1 dummy variables
  + $k$ = number of levels

---
# Steps in dummy coding by hand
1. Choose a baseline level

2. Assign everyone in the baseline  group `0` for all $k$-1 dummy variables

3. Assign everyone in the next group a `1` for the first dummy variable and a `0` for all the other dummy variables

4. Assign everyone in the next again group a `1` for the second dummy variable and a `0` for all the other dummy variables

5. Repeat until all $k$-1 dummy variables have had 0's and 1's assigned

6. Enter the $k$-1 dummy variables into your regression


---
#  Choosing a baseline? 
+ Each level of your categorical predictor will be compared against the baseline.

+ Good baseline levels could be:
	+ The control group in an experiment
	+ The group expected to have the lowest score on the outcome
	+ The largest group

+ It is best the baseline is not:
	+ A poorly defined level, e.g. an `Other` group
	+ Much smaller than the other groups



---
#  Dummy coding by hand

.pull-left[
+ We start out with  a dataset that looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
test_study3 %>%
  dplyr::select(ID,score,method) %>%
  slice(1:10)
```


]


.pull-right[
+ And end up with one that looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dummyCoded <- test_study3 %>%
  select(ID, score, method) %>%
  mutate(
    method1 = ifelse(method == "self-test", 1, 0),
    method2 = ifelse(method == "summarise", 1, 0))

dummyCoded %>% 
  slice(1:10)
```

#  Dummy coding with `lm` 

+ `lm` automatically applies dummy coding when you include a variable of class `factor` in a model.
  + It selects the first group (alphabetically) as the baseline group

```{r}
contrasts(test_study3$method)

.pull-left[
+ The intercept is the mean of the baseline group (notes re-reading)

# Part 5: Testing manual contrasts using emmeans

# Using `emmeans` to test contrasts

+ We will use the package `emmeans` to test our contrasts
  + We will also be using this in the next few weeks to look at analysing experimental designs.

+ **E**stimated
+ **M**arginal
+ **Means**

+ Essentially this package provides us with a lot of tools to help us model contrasts and linear functions.

---
# Working with `emmeans`

```{r, echo = F}
test_study3 <- df3 %>%
  dplyr::select(y, hours, motivation, study, method) %>%
  mutate(
    ID = paste("ID", 101:350, sep = ""),
    score = round(y+abs(min(y))),
    motivation = round(motivation, 2),
    study = factor(study),
    method = factor(method)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(ID, score, hours, motivation, study, method)
```

+ We already have our model:

```{r, eval=F}
mod1 <- lm(score ~ method, test_study3)
```

+ Next we use `emmeans` to get the estimated means of our groups.

```{r}
method_mean <- emmeans(mod1, ~method)

method_mean
```


---
# Visualise estimated means

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(method_mean)
```

+ We then use these means to test contrasts

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(method_mean)
```

]

---
# Defining the contrast

+ **KEY POINT**: The order of your categorical variable matters as `emmeans` uses this order. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
contrasts <- contrasts(test_study3$method)

contrasts %>% 
  kable(.) %>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```


```{r}
levels(test_study3$method)
```

```{r}
method_comp <- list("Reading vs Self-Testing" = c(1, -1, 0),
                    "Reading vs Summarising" = c(1, 0, -1),
                    "Self-Testing vs Summarising" = c(0, 1, -1))

```


---
# Requesting the test
+ In order to test our effects, we use the `contrast` function from `emmeans`

```{r}
method_comp_test <- contrast(method_mean, method_comp)
method_comp_test
```
--

+ We can see we have p-values, but we can also request confidence intervals

```{r}
confint(method_comp_test)
```


---
# Interpreting the results
+ The estimate is the difference between the average of the group means within each chunk.

.pull-left[

```{r, eval = F}
method_comp_test
```


```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/contrastEstimates.png')

```{r, eval = F}
method_mean
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/contrastMeans.png')

]
+ So for `Self-Testing vs Summarising` :

```{r}
27.6-24.2
```
+ So those who test themselves on the content of their notes have higher scores than those who simply read their notes.
  + And this is significant.

# Summary of today
+ When we have categorical predictors, we are modelling the means of groups
  
+ A categorical variable with 2 levels can be represented as a binary (0,1) variable
  + The associated $\beta$ is the difference between groups

+ When the categorical predictor has more than one level, we can represent it with dummy coded variables.
  + We have k-1 dummy variables, where k = levels
  + Each dummy represents the difference between the mean of the group scored 1 and the reference group

+ In R, we need to make sure... 
  + R recognises the variable as a factor (`factor()`), and 
  + we have the correct reference level (`contr.treatment()`)

+ We also looked at the use of `emmeans` to test specific contrasts.
  + Run the model
  + Estimate the means
  + Define the contrast
  + Test the contrast
