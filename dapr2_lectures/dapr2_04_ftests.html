# Part 1: Recap and `\(F\)`-tests

---
# Where we left off...
+ Last week we looked at:
  + The significance of individual predictors
  + Overall model evaluation through `\(R^2\)` and adjusted `\(R^2\)` to see how much variance in the outcome has been explained.

+ Today we will:
  + Look at significance tests of the overall model
  + Discuss how we can use the same tools to do incremental tests (how much does my model improve when I add variables)
  + Interpreting models based on standardized coefficients.

---
#  Significance of the overall model 
+ The test of the individual predictors (IVs, or `\(x\)`'s) does not tell us if the overall model is significant or not.
	+ Neither does R-square
	+ But both are indicative

+ To test the significance of the model as a whole, we conduct an `\(F\)`-test.


---
#  F-test &amp; F-ratio
+ An `\(F\)`-test involves testing the statistical significance of a test statistic called (wait for it) the `\(F\)`-ratio.

+ The `\(F\)`-ratio tests the null hypothesis that all the regression slopes in a model are all zero.

--

  + In other words, our predictors tell us nothing about our outcome.
  + They explain no variance.

--

  + If our predictors do explain some variance, our `\(F\)`-ratio will be significant.

#  F-ratio: Some details
+ `\(F\)`-ratio is a ratio of the explained to unexplained variance:

`$$F = \frac{\frac{SS_{model}}{df_{model}}}{\frac{SS_{residual}}{df_{residual}}} = \frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{Residual}}$$`

+ Where MS = mean squares

--

+ **What are mean squares?**
  + Mean squares are sums of squares calculations divided by the associated degrees of freedom.
  + We saw how to calculate model and residual sums of squares last week

+ But what are degrees of freedom...

---
# Degrees of freedom
+ The degrees of freedom are defined as the number of independent values associated with the different calculations.
  + Df are typically the combination of the amount of data you have (sample size) and the number of things you need to calculate/estimate.

+ **Residual degrees of freedom = n-k-1**
  + `\(SS_{residual}\)` calculation is based on our model, in which we estimate k `\(\beta\)` terms (-k) and an intercept (-1)

+ **Total degrees of freedom = n-1**
  + `\(SS_{total}\)` calculation is based on the observed `\(y_i\)` and `\(\bar{y}\)` . 
  + In order to estimate `\(\bar{y}\)` , all apart from one value of `\(y\)` is free to vary, hence n-1

+ **Model degrees of freedom = k**
  + `\(SS_{model}\)` are dependent on estimated `\(\beta\)` , hence k.

# F-ratio
+ Bigger `\(F\)`-ratios indicate better models.
  + It means the model variance is big compared to the residual variance.

--

+ The null hypothesis for the model says that the best guess of any individuals `\(y\)` value is the mean of `\(y\)` plus error.
	+ Or, that the `\(x\)` variables carry no information collectively about `\(y\)`.
	+ I.e. the slopes all = 0

--

+ `\(F\)`-ratio will be close to 1 when the null hypothesis is true
  + If there is equivalent residual to model variation, `\(F\)`=1
	+ If there is more model than residual `\(F\)` &gt; 1

---
# Testing the significance of `\(F\)`

+ The `\(F\)`-ratio is our test statistic for the significance of our model. 
  + As with all statistical inferences, we would select an `\(\alpha\)` level.
  + Calculate the critical value of `\(F\)` associated with this.
  + And then compare our value to the critical value.
  
+ The `\(F\)`-ratio is then evaluated against an `\(F\)`-distribution with `\(df_{Model}\)` and `\(df_{Residual}\)` and a pre-defined `\(\alpha\)`
  + This provides us with the test of the overall model.

# Part 2: Model Comparison &amp; Incremental `\(F\)`-tests

---
# Model comparisons
+ The core of the model comparison question is to ask:

**When I make a change to my model, does it improve or not**

+ So far, our questions have really been is our overall model better than nothing ( `\(F\)`-test )

+ But what if instead we wanted to ask, is a model with `\(x1\)` and `\(x2\)` and `\(x3\)` as predictors, better than the model with just `\(x1\)`?

+ In our linear model journey so far, we haven't yet explored the tools to answer this question. 

+ Why?
  + Well we have tested individual predictors
  + and we have tested overall models
  + **but we have not tested the improvement when we add two (or more predictors)**


---
# `\(F\)`-test as an incremental test

+ One important way we can think about the `\(F\)`-test and the `\(F\)`-ratio is as an incremental test against an "empty" or null model.

+ A null or empty model is a linear model with only the intercept.
  + In this model, our predicted value of the outcome for every case in our data set, is the mean of the outcome.
  + That is, with no predictors, we have no information that may help us predict the outcome.
  + So we will be "least wrong" by guessing the mean of the outcome.

+ An empty model is the same as saying all `\(\beta\)` = 0.

+ And remember, this was the null hypothesis of the `\(F\)`-test

---
# `\(F\)`-test as an incremental test
+ So in this way, the `\(F\)`-test can be seen as **comparing two models**.

+ We can extend this idea, and use the `\(F\)`-test to compare two models that contain different sets of predictors.
  + This is the **incremental `\(F\)`-test**

---
# Incremental `\(F\)`-test
.pull-left[
+ The incremental `\(F\)`-test evaluates the statistical significance of the improvement in variance explained in an outcome with the addition of further predictor(s)

+ It is based on the difference in `\(F\)`-values between two models.
  + We call the model with the additional predictor(s) model 1 or full model
  + We call the model without model 0 or restricted model

# Why does this matter?
+ A very reasonable question you may have at this point is "so what, why does that matter?"

+ Well, it is very useful if we every want to formally compare two models and decide which is the better one.

+ And that is what we will discuss next!

# Example 1: The models
+ Does personality significantly predict self-rated health over and above the effects of age and sex?

+ Second step
  + Compare the two models based on an incremental `\(F\)`-test

+ In order to apply the `\(F\)`-test for model comparison in R, we use the `anova()` function.

+ `anova()` takes as its arguments models that we wish to compare

# Model comparison for non-nested models
+ So what happens when we have non-nested models?

+ There are two commonly used alternatives
  + AIC
  + BIC

+ Unlike the incremental `\(F\)`-test AIC and BIC do not require two models to be nested

# Considerations for use of AIC and BIC
+ The AIC and BIC for a single model are not meaningful
  + They only make sense for model comparisons

+ AIC and BIC can be used for both nested and non-nested models.

+ For AIC, there are no cut-offs to suggest how big a difference in two models is needed to conclude that one is substantively better than the other

+ For BIC, a difference of 10 can be used as a rule of thumb to suggest that one model is substantively better than another

# Pause to summarise what we know so far

+ So far we have seen how to:
  + run a linear model with a single predictor
  + extend this and add predictors
  + interpret these coefficients either in original units or standardized units
  + test the significance of `\(\beta\)` coefficients
  + test the significance of the overall model
  + estimate the amount of variance explained by our model

+ Short version, well done, you can now run and interpret linear models with continuous predictors.

+ Next week we will put this into action constructing and implementing an analysis plan for a linear model on a real example.
