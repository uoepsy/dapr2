CMV:Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government,"Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses  not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you.

If I went around saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me  they'd put me away.

However  given the current state of politics  I'm willing to consider alternatives to democracy.

"CMV: Netflix is becoming less of a way to ""cut the cable"", and more like just another premium cable service like HBO.","Here are my views:

1) By focusing on original content  Netflix is becoming less of an alternative to a cable subscription  and more of just another (albeit amazing and unparalleled) HBO type service.

2) Due to this and the glut of other subscription streaming services  the dream of drastically lower costs for the average consumer by ""cutting the cable"" while retaining most of the benefits of a traditional television are slipping away to the realities of a fragmented subscription market.

___

When Netflix came out and started gaining steam  the was a lot of talk about how it would possibly replace traditional  expensive cable bills.  But as the market has developed  it seems to me that Netflix has changed.  If I look at how I've used Netflix over the past couple years  it is almost entirely driven by their original programming.  And indeed  this is what Netflix wants  and I do love their original shows.  But it isn't replacing cable for me.  I don't really watch their movie/TV show selection much anymore because I've already seen most of what I'm interested in.  Narcos and Stranger Things and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are great  but they are just fleshing out the lineup of shows I like in conjunction with all the other shows that I can only get with my $100 a month cable subscription.  I also like to watch the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones and the news.  If I want to watch the new Star Trek  now I have to shell out even more money for another subscription service.  If I want to watch sports I need either an expensive subscription ($40+ just for sports) or my normal cable subscription.  Now Disney is starting their own subscription service as well.  If I want Hulu's offerings  that is another subscription.  My point is that yes  if Netflix had been allowed to grow without competition it would be great to have one company dominate streaming and have all the content in one place for one cost.  But obviously other companies want to get in on it too.

I expect the main counterargument to this is that you don't NEED every scrap of content out there  so you can cut the cable and just get by with less entertainment.  Fair enough.  But that isn't really fulfilling *my* dream of cable cutting.  I didn't envision that these services would morph into a low budget option for people who can live with less content than they used to get.  In fact  I suspect that in this age of streaming options  most people will spend roughly the same amount for TV entertainment as before.  Because most people I know are still going to keep their cable subscription  and supplement it with a couple streaming options of their choice.  Realistically  I don't think we are in for an age of drastically lower prices.  It is a great option for a low budget or a college kid who can now get a LOT of value for $10 a month  but I bet the average person doesn't save any money in this new age of streaming.

EDIT:  So after reading all of your really well thought out comments  I still think I retain my view.  However  I do have a greater understanding of what cable cutting is for most people.  I appreciate more that Netflix's trajectory is just fine for a lot of people.  And that if you don't care about certain specific aspects of live TV (news  sports  etc)  then it really is possible to pay less and get rid of your cable bill.  But I still believe that we aren't really in a new paradigm of cable cutting like some predicted. Until subscription services are the default instead of cable  most people I know (for what it's worth...) are going to keep both.  And due to realities of the business that many of you pointed out  it isn't Netflix's goal to fill every niche.  So hopefully we can all agree that the view I expressed isn't really wrong  but it misses the point.

CMV: Thank You Cards are a waste of time and money and sending them is a social convention that we should move away from,"The first  and I think most obvious argument  is that most circumstances that would usually necessitate writing Thank You cards for (ex. Weddings  birthdays  graduations) the honored party has probably already thanked in person most or all of the people who came and/or gave a gift already. Personally  I think this in-person thank you is more genuine than a card.

Secondly  why should the honored party have to pay for postage  envelopes  and the cards themselves  as well as spend up to several hours writing and addressing cards saying thank you for something that has already been thanked for?

It seems like such a waste when  to my last point  most of the people who receive the card will most likely open it up  look at it and say something like ""hmm  that was nice."" Then throw it away (or at most  stick it to the fridge for a week). That's what I do when I get one.

All this to say  I'm not an ungrateful person. I truly am thankful to the people who came to my event. I just think that Thank You cards are completely unnecessary.

CMV: Our current Speed limit system(USA) is terrible and abused by police to fine the public.,"To me the term speed limit should be the fastest anyone is traveling on a certain road. If the speed limit is 55 drivers should be going 45-54 safely.

How it actually is that 55 is the minimum speed drivers typically drive 55-65 and anyone going 50 will be viewed as going to slow and an unsafe driver.

Yet a cop can and will issue tickets for going 5-10 over the speed limit which realistically means they can pull over 50%+ of all drivers at basically any time to give out tickets.

There are 3 lane roads in my area with a speed limit of 25 that should realistically be driven at 40-50 mph safely.

CMV: Overbooking should be illegal.,"So this is sparked by the United thing  but is unrelated to issues around forcible removal or anything like that.  Simply put  I think it should be illegal for an airline (or bus or any other service) to sell more seats than they have for a given trip.  It is a fraudulent representation to customers that the airline is going to transport them on a given flight  when the airline knows it cannot keep that promise to all of the people that it has made the promise to.

I do not think a ban on overbooking would do much more than codify the general common law elements of fraud to airlines.  [Those elements are:](https://www.mitchell-attorneys.com/common-law-fraud)

>(1) a representation of fact; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the representerÕs knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) the representerÕs intent that it should be acted upon by the person in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the injured partyÕs ignorance of its falsity; (7) the injured partyÕs reliance on its truth; (8) the injured partyÕs right to rely thereon; and (9) the injured partyÕs consequent and proximate injury.

I think all 9 are met in the case of overbooking and that it is fully proper to ban overbooking under longstanding legal principles.

Edit: largest view change is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/64kkxe/cmv_overbooking_should_be_illegal/dg339e5/) relating to a proposal that airlines be allowed to overbook  but not to involuntarily bump  and that they must keep raising the offer of money until they get enough volunteers  no matter how high the offer has to go.

Edit 2: It has been 3 hours  and my inbox can't take any more.  Love you all  but I'm turning off notifications for the thread.

"CMV: I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.","So  let me give some background. From a young age  I was a slave on the desert planet  known as Tatooine. And let me tell you  there was sand *everywhere*. It got in my eyes at times  during sandstorms  I was cut and bruised just by all of that coarse  gritty sand. Really  it was all there was in sight  and I really just could not get away from the stuff fast enough. I've been avoiding places with a lot of sand  since then  and it's really strained some family relationships. I'm considering going back to see my mother  if she's even still alive  just to rescue her from those cruel people down there.

Now  my girlfriend  on the other hand (I'm not sure if we're really  ""official"" yet  but we're basically a thing)  she actually seems to have sort of an affinity for the stuff. She told me that she loved swimming to this one island with all of her school friends when she was younger  and then just lying there  on that disgusting  coarse  gritty sand until the sun dried them out. I really don't know what she sees in sand  honestly. I mean  how can you like something so  so coarse? So rough? So irritating? Not to mention  it gets *everywhere*  as I've mentioned before.

I really don't want this to become a strain on our relationship. At the same time  I just can't stand sand. It's so awful  not to mention all the savages that live *in* the sand  particularly on Tatooine. Maybe I'm wrong about sand  maybe I'm being unfair to it. I was wondering if someone could give me a different perspective on sand.",54,1,1,4,4,"[['face.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/0/02/jar_jar_swsb.png/revision/latest?cb=20160910034613)'], ['beach](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/13/4c/f8/134cf8a1a4cb872485265cbf8ce92151.jpg)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart']]",1,9,1,No
CMV: Martin Shkreli (the creepy drug price hike guy) is a humbling reminder that Internet outrage is totally powerless to affect anything that matters,"**edit3: I had to delete most of my comments due to an unrelated problem. My view has still been changed  and all deltas were legitimately awarded and deserved. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.**

**edit2: In an ironic turn of fate it appears that Shkreli has in fact been arrested as of 2015/12/17. Whether he will be convicted is up for debate but it's quite possible he may be punished for his actions. I've already given out a lot of deltas but this is the final nail on the coffin on my view  so to speak.**

People seem to think that liking things on facebook or being outraged on reddit has an effect on the real world. The only cases where I've found this to be true is when redditors tormented a family who had nothing to do with the Boston Marathon Bombing  or other events where someone did something the websites didn't like and got canned for it such as the dongles joke. It's only the witch hunts on *defenseless* people that work.  

In practice  when it comes to things that actually matter  nothing can be done by online petitions. Martin Shkreli is one such example  no one on reddit can do anything about him despite their rage. The witch hunt fails because he is actually powerful. In fact  sharing things online and clicking the like button probably makes you less likely to actually do anything in real life because of the feeling that you have already contributed. That is why slacktivism is dangerous. People have this mindset that one like = one dead terrorist. In reality  the salient topic is forgotten within days  to be replaced by a vine or some other controversy.  

Another worrying trend is that online communities are easily manipulated. All you have to do is pay a few interns to flood comment sections. In fact there is a theory that Shkreli himself has played the internet like a fiddle (I can't find the post detailing this anymore unfortunately) There is a 100% chance that I have been manipulated like this in the past myself without being aware of it  usually it's by advertising astroturf. It's hardly an elaborate tinfoil conspiracy  simply an online medium that is trivially easy to game. It means you have the illusion of being informed when in fact you are ensconcing yourself in an echo chamber. Look at any political themed subreddit to find evidence of this.  

If you have at least a few examples of online outrage achieving something positive and durable  or some other hard evidence  please share and I'll be willing to change my view.

edit: there is an onslaught of new comments and I can't keep up. Will tune in later.

"CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror","

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience  a loud noise will startle everyone  you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare  to make the viewer feel safe  and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity  The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door  to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However  a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares  most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream  but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror.

I believe that the rabbit in the Trix commercials should be allowed to eat Trix cereal. CMV.,"For as long as I can remember  the TV commercials for Trix cereal have followed the same pattern: a well-meaning white rabbit wants nothing more than to enjoy the supposed deliciousness of Trix cereal  but his attempts are repeatedly shut down by antagonistic children who  without fail  close with the catch phrase ""silly rabbit  Trix are for kids!""

I believe that these commercials (specifically because of the fact that the rabbit is consistently forbidden from enjoying Trix cereal) lead to the following ill effects:

* They encourage (to a target audience of children  no less) exclusivity and discrimination towards those who fall outside of one's own demographic ('kids ' in this case). 

* They frustrate viewers who are empathetic with the Rabbit and want to see him find happiness.

* They are arguably counterproductive; I refuse to buy Trix cereal until the rabbit begins receiving fair treatment in Trix commercials  and I would imagine I am not the only one. 

Change my view. 

edit: to all the 'Trix are for kids' comments; that is what I am saying should change. They don't give any good reason for it.

CMV: YouTube Kids should be based on a whitelist of approved channels.,"You might have heard about the controversy associated with YouTube Kids  which has [frequently suggested bizarre and often disturbing and/or violent cartoons for children and parents.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16629788/youtube-kids-distrubing-inappropriate-flag-age-restrict) Very many of these cartoons show iconic  copyrighted characters engaging in out-of-character behavior  including [depictions of Elsa engaging in gun violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDgokvFC_-E). These videos are quite controversial and can be traumatizing to children  and furthermore may harm iconic and beloved brands. 

If YouTube is going to be explicitly branding towards children  they need to ensure that every video they offer is both a) child-friendly and b) depicts characters in a way that's consistent with their creators' intentions. I'm not at all opposed to fanfiction  but Elsa robbing a bank is not something that is child-friendly and not something that fits with Disney's intention or reputation at all. What I think should happen is that YouTube Kids should be limited to channels that are reviewed by humans who are employed by a reputable firm (either YouTube employees or the firms whose intellectual property is being used) and verified to ensure that they are age appropriate.

That being said  I would say I have a fair amount of confidence in my ability to execute correct grammar and spelling. However  since I am human  I am liable to make mistakes from time to time.

CMV: Google Maps Calorie Counter was a great idea and people complaining are being ridiculous.,"Google pulled their their calorie tracker after facing backlash from the public. A lot of people calling foul and wanting heads. 

Verge article: https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487622/google-maps-remove-mini-cupcake-calorie-counter-ios-apps

I am off the belief that itÕs not that big of a deal. They say (no proof) that it could trigger people with eating disorders. How? Is this the only thing that could trigger folks with eating disorders? No? Why not highlight those other things? Because Google is a popular enough company and should know better?

Citymapper apparently had this feature for a while now and has managed to stay under the radar  why? Because they arenÕt as popular? Seems hypocritical to me. ÒLetÕs just Attack google because theyÕre a big company and this will bring more eyeballs to my twitter profile. Bah. 

Almost everyone these days uses some kind of smart watch/fitness tracker thingamabobber. WhatÕs the difference if your Apple Watch tells you to stand up and move around every hour?

Google provided a free mapping app and is constantly experimenting. It decided to experiment with the idea of showing calories you could potentially burn if you chose to walk. Chastise then instead because thereÕs no way to opt out? ItÕs a free product! Next youÕll be taking pitchforks to Apple because the weather reported in Apple maps isnÕt accurate to the degree.

CMV: Reddit should hide the scores of posts until the user has voted for themselves.,"There's no denying this site has a problem with hive-mind mentality. The voting system naturally censors unpopular viewpoints  but I believe seeing the current score before voting for yourself compromises the integrity of the individual vote  leading to more of a band wagon response. Waiting to reveal the current score until after the individual user has cast his would also prompt users to vote more often. This is good because those votes would naturally push the content in a direction that the users appreciate.
To reiterate (and for easy rebuttal):
1. The votes would become more honest
2. The votes would become more frequent.

CMV: Luigi is the superior Mario Brother.,"You heard me. Now's the time to wake up  sheeple. Today  I'm going to peel the wool from your eyes and reveal the truth--that Luigi is the better of the two Mario bros and he deserves our respect  trust  and dignity.

(1) **Luigi is green.** Have you seen that shade of green he rocks? That's some serious green right there. Green is a tranquil color. Green is often used to signify safety  ie 'green means go'  or terror alert level green is the safest. Trees. Grass. Cucumbers. Nature. What is the color red? Warning. Stop. Danger. Blood. Communism. Nazism. Absolute chaos. Mario's primary color choice is the embodiment of fear underscored with a tonality of madness. Who's more likely to cut you off  a green station wagon or a red sports car? Point  Luigi.

(2) **As player two  you can see the mistakes player one makes.** Didn't realize there's a hole there? Maybe they missed a block. Hell  maybe they missed a pipe? Those who play Mario just plow along  unabated with interest to their surroundings. Luigi players are more observant. Careful.

(3) **Luigi is quirkier in games.** He can jump higher. He's got a cool headbutt move. He can do everything Mario can  only better. Mario  on the other hand  symbolizes normalcy. There is literally a trope called ""The Mario""  underscoring a character that is  on the whole  average in every conceivable way. Luigi breaks from that mold  finding a new way to stand out without going to great excess.

(4) **Luigi is monogamous.** He has had only one lover in his heart  Princess Daisy. Mario  on the other hand  is an insidious malcontent with a long string of lovers. Sure  you may remember Princess Peach  but what of Pauline? The woman from Donkey Kong? After she was rescued  she had been tossed under the bus outright  a mere pawn for Mario's rescuing-based sexual fetish. Hell  Mario still sees Pauline from time to time  but only of Donkey Kong is involved (and minis  for some reason).  And remember Daisy from earlier? Yeah  she's from the Super Mario Land series on the Game Boy. This means that Mario went from Pauline  to Peach aka Toadstool  to Daisy  then back to Peach! Luckily  Luigi was their to pick up the pieces after Mario broke Daisy's heart and showed her what a real man looked like. That's how it has remained ever since.

(5) **Luigi has the better mustache.** Go ahead and GIS it right now. Compare and contract the different mustaches. Luigi's is a fine affair  torn straight from the pages of yesteryear  invoking that turn-of-the-century ideas of being a strong  stalwart gentleman. Mario's mustache looks like a curtain and invokes that feeling of a seedy bastard leaving a 1970s porno theater.

(6) **Luigi has the better personality.** Strictly speaking  he actually has a personality. He can come off as a bit scared at times  but I remember a quote saying that true bravery is knowing your fear and overcoming it for the sake of a greater good. This is Luigi in a nutshell. He realizes his life is finite  but he knows what is to be done. Mario recklessly strides into the darkest depths of infinity. Mario is not brave. Mario is at the least fool-hearty and at its extremes suicidal!

(7) **Luigi is taller.** I know you are chomping at the bit  ready to call me 'height-ist' or whatever  but hear me out. Even if we can exclude all previously listed elements and all else was constant  we know that Luigi is taller. He can reach a higher shelves. He's got a longer stride. You can call me what you what  but at the end of the day  who are you going to ask to get that jar of pickles from the top shelf?

And I haven't even begin explore all options  here! He is not the Green Mario you make him out to be. Mario is  in fact  the Red Luigi. Now  merely try to CMV.


**EDIT:** I really did not expect this much response to something so trivial. I want to thank you all for your participation today and you are  of course  welcome to argue in my absence.

As for me  Luigi will be my favorite  literally forever. That bitch got me Reddit Gold! That is literally blowing my mind.

However  I do subscribe to the multiverse Luigi theory now  so.. Point somewhat changed?

CMV: Caller ID spoofing should be made entirely illegal.,"Caller ID spoofing is the practice of transmitting digital information with a phone call representing a number as the dialing number other than that which is actually the dialing number.

I believe this practice should be made entirely illegal  and that either the accurate calling number  or else no number  must be transmitted.

Spoofing is overwhelmingly used by scammers and spammers  and is a major technique of fraud.  While some users have an interest in spoofing which is more legitimate  those interests can generally be accommodated through just blocking caller ID (displaying no number).

Because spoofing is so prevalent in illegal and deceptive activity  and because it is inherently deceptive  and because the legitimate users of the service have a non-deceptive alternative  I believe spoofing should be banned  and that the government should promulgate regulations to telecommunications companies banning the practice entirely.

CMV: I think many people posting CMVs don't actually want to be convinced of anything but just want an outlet to make an argument/rant that they are proud of.,"Often these threads espouse completely reasonable views and offer no motive whatsoever as to why somebody would want this view changed (ex: ""Hitler was bad"" ""Climate change is a real thing"" or ""People should be nice to each other CMV"") **EDIT:** There also seems to be a lack of open-mindedness and common abandonment of new threads by some OPs. If anything these people just want to argue and/or change the views of those who respond to them.

Usually lots of commenters respond to the post with long explanations and attempts at changing the perspective or changing the terms of the argument as a whole  but the OP just inevitably sidesteps it or ignores it altogether. OPs in these posts rarely concede points  even if they don't entirely change their views. Most of the time the OP won't even be active in the discussions in the comment section--yet the moderators won't remove their post for violating either rule E or B. This is because it is often pretty dicey to decide what really constitutes soapboxing and what is a genuine post.

~~As an auxiliary view  I think the rules should be amended to ""must include a motive for why you want this view to be changed.""~~ This view has already been changed. It would be detrimental to the sub to attempt this.

Otherwise we get a bunch of posts like these:

~~[one of the top posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1xfnri/i_believe_its_insensitive_to_expect_the_poor_to/)~~ This one was problematic for several reasons so I've removed it.

[another top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/20293g/i_believe_that_reactionary_responses_to_terrorist/)

[then there are a bunch of these every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2iruvl/cmv_i_think_we_should_ban_people_from_major_ebola/)

[like this thread  currently top of CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2j5lqx/cmv_columbus_day_is_a_national_embarrassment_and/)


I want this view changed because I want to be convinced that there's some underlying benefit to such posts or that there is generally just something I'm missing. Currently I feel like these sorts of flotsam posts detract from the spirit of the subreddit as a whole.


**EDIT:** Amended some of the original post to indicate where the discussion has gone so far and what has been changed.

**EDIT2:** It seems the discussion has mainly ended up at the position that  despite the intention of the OP  the posts foster intellectual dialogue and debates which can be quite fruitful just for their own sake and that *this* is what makes the subreddit the gem it is today. I agree that it's a beautiful thing and that this is something to be encouraged (and I awarded a delta to somebody who allowed me to see this perspective) but remember that **the expressed purpose of the subreddit is ""For people who have an opinion on something but accept that they may be wrong or want help changing their view""** and that what I'm claiming is that many people don't actually hold either of those views. The argument goes that we can't really determine what someone's intentions *are* in the first place and so censorship of posts on these bases would be messy to say the least. I completely agree with that assessment. I still think that many people (perhaps even most) post here because they want to test their view against an educated public scrutiny and I admire that motive  but while *I do not think that is in keeping with the purpose of the sub* I also think that it somehow manages to *keep with the spirit of the sub.* I might be teetering on the brink of a large view change so please feel free to address this new edit if you so choose.

**EDIT3:** It seems another common thread between many posts is that a lot of these OPs I speak of are really using /r/changemyview as /r/challengemyview and I agree that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd leave it to the mods to determine how that jives with the rules  function  and purpose of the subreddit  but to answer all of you at once  I think it is still slightly disingenuous (even if it produces positive results in the end) to post a view you have no intention of changing but just want to bounce around. I think something should be done about that. One person suggested renaming the sub to /r/challengemyview and  while implausible  that would be the kind of provision that would placate me. Perhaps just an explicit rule in the sidebar saying ""views can/cannot be voiced in terms of a challenge"" (the decision whether to permit or forbid left at the discretion of the mods of course) would suffice. It just seems to me that somebody who so firmly holds a view that they'd voice it as a challenge aren't *usually* open to having it changed  but to test its strength in battle so to speak. Thoughts?

**EDIT4:** Really happy to see the vigorous discussion going on in here. Something else I've noticed as I've read all of your posts: there seems to be an unintentional conflating of the prescriptive and the descriptive. Many of you are talking about how  in practice  this sub ends up garnering a lot of valuable intellectual dialogue due to the sometimes adversarial (""challenging"") nature of posts. I agree that I like that too (as stated earlier) but I think that we should try shifting the focus a little bit more to the prescriptive (""what *should* CMV be like and what is it meant to be""). I think certain policies might have different implications on the culture/atmosphere of this sub  like removing plausibly deniable soapbox posts or  conversely  allowing them  by amending the rules to include challenges or an explicitly lax requirement on OP feedback. One person suggested including /r/offmychest on the sidebar for those who just want to vent. What do you guys think the implications might be for these policies? I'm not sure I really hold a side on these but my view is definitely open to being changed toward one.

**EDIT5:** *No* this post is not ironic or a tu quoque fallacy.

CMV: Harry Potter has an awful magic system which severely weakens the plot,"**READ THIS**

~~Hey folks this is a really cool conversation  I am enjoying hearing your points of view! But I have to go to bed now  shit's late.
I will pick up on replying to more of these and continuing this sometime tomorrow after my lectures~~


EDIT #2: 

Holy shit this has exploded  I never expected this to get as big as it has. I am slowly working my way through the different arguments. 

It seems very evident that I failed to highlight the main point of my argument  as people are diving into semantics arguments focusing on specific side points to the overall message. 

The basis of what I am arguing is better explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5p1lo2/cmv_harry_potter_has_an_awful_magic_system_which/dcnscwx/?st=iy61scrc&sh=0f2eab35).

EDIT #3: Everyone and their grandmother is getting held up on the wandless magic point  referencing pottermore and the later books where that is established  but that was just a symptom of the overall issue I have with the series which is better outlined in that comment and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5p1lo2/cmv_harry_potter_has_an_awful_magic_system_which/dcnt1fz/?st=iy62qdsp&sh=cd2cbe73) as well (Last half of that comment). 

There may be arguments that convince me already on the post  but due to how complex these posts are its taking me some time to get through and evaluate them all. 

Thanks!

Hey there  so to start things off  yes Harry Potter is a good story  I am a fan of the book series overall  but this issue is a major gripe for me.

Second  I have not read the books recently  this is a thought holdout that I've had for years.

----
I love stories that set out the rules for a magic system  and then navigate their plots through that system while keeping it consistent. 

A couple examples of a consistent magic system are Eragon and The Kingkiller Chronicles. On the macro scale both of these systems are very similar  the magic that happens is rooted in an energy balance. 

In KC  you can light a cigarette by taking energy from your own body  or a nearby fire  etc. which will then cool as a result. And the further away something is  the higher the cost.

In Eragon  all actions require a similar energy  its a bit more ethereal than KC  but still has very defined limits. Users can't do very much before they are exhausted  so they need to draw on sources of power such as other people  or stored potential energy that was previously harvested.

The point is that  these relationships are established early on in the book series  and while characters refine their abilities  and learn more about the magic system  the base rules continue to apply. 

---
In Harry Potter  the rules are laid out in some of the initial magic lessons  but as the series progress  almost everything that has been established gets thrown away. 

Even worse  in many cases whole plot devices are reliant on just some new form of magic that the reader had no idea was a possibility. 

- Exceptional spell pronunciation and precise wand movement is explained to be essential for a spell to function at all  but then later we end up losing the pronunciation and wand movement entirely. Magic can just happen wordlessly and without a wand.  

- There's essentially no limit to a magic users abilities once you figure out a spell for the first time. You could cast Avada Kedavra all day long. 

- Magic detection is entirely inconsistent. They can use the ""trace"" to detect *any* magic from someone underage *anywhere*  but can't at all tell when someone in the middle of the Ministry of Magic in under a Polyjuice potion? What is this huge magic detection network that allows the ""trace"" to work? How is it not being used for other things?

- Spells have a mind of their own  ala Accio and Crucio

- Incredibly overpowered items like the Time-turner effectively break the universe

I remember having other examples but it has been a while since I read the books.

(EDIT: Bolded this for emphasis  this is the thesis of my argument.)


**In summary 
to me  it feels like JK wrote herself in to corners fairly often and then had to default to ""Because magic"" as the solution. It really irritated me when I read the series for the first time  and I have never been convinced otherwise by friends when Harry Potter gets brought up.**

CMV: The Walking Dead isn't that good.,"First  let me admit there's incredible episodes such as Conquer  Last Day On Earth and The Same Boat and that the show isn't terrible.    
My main problem with with it it's that it's BORING. A gigantic part of it is characters being emotional and giving monotonous (sometimes incomprehensible) speeches or figthing with each other instead of things actually happening  and there's another gigantic part of the show that shit sorta happens but there's no tension  like when the walkers came for Alexandria or the barn.      
There's a reason for this  yeah  the show is trying to be realistic  but the point of fiction is not to create another reality with maximmum acuraccy to our reality  it's to create a more interesting reality than ours. Our world is boring as shit.        
The show is also predictable. The group finds a settlement  shit happens and a lot of people die  Rick magically saves everybody and recruits new people on his crew  cycle repeats. The new people on his crew are probably boring as fuck  like Noah or Deanna  and they're mostly the ones that die. This is made so that the show can kill a shitton of people  and still avoid killing characters enjoyed by the public.    
Another unpopular opinion  while we are at that  by the way: Shane is one of the best characters in the show and he was MOSTLY right  except for almost raping Lori.

"CMV: The lack of a ""back"" button on an iPhone is a dealbreaker","EDIT: My view has not been changed 180 degrees  but it's more nuanced and I now better understand the reasons people have to disliking a 'back' button. The biggest point for me is that while iOS 'back' functions are unintuitive by location (different situations call for different navigation commands/navigation buttons appear in different parts of the screen depending on the app)  the Android 'back' button is potentially unintuitive by function (it's always in the same place  but pressing it may do something different from what you expected).

I learned quite a bit about how to use the iOS as well  though some of them yielded more questions than answers (that's another CMV for another day). For now  thanks for your responses!

----------------------

I really hate Apple's design philosophy in general  but since I know my opinion is generally unpopular  I decided to start small and post about one particular design decision - the lack of a back button. Why is the lack of one such a big deal to me?

**It's a waste of space.** One of the biggest selling points of the iPhone when it first came out (and why almost everyone uses touchscreen phones now) is the maximizing of screenspace - the screen takes up almost the entire area of the phone. Nevertheless  almost every app needs a way to go back  so there is a 'back' button onscreen. This takes up valuable screenspace  when there is perfectly fine real estate either side of the home button which isn't doing anything.

**It's inefficient in many situations.** Take this situation: I'm riding shotgun to an appointment and giving directions to the driver. Guy I'm meeting texts to ask if I'm on the way. After replying to his message  I want to go back to my navigation app as quickly as possible to make sure we don't miss a turn  but instead of just pressing the 'back' button  I have to doublepress the home button  find Googlemaps  then tap on it. Seems like a small difference  but it really adds up! Take a more extreme (but still relatively common) scenario:

Someone has just sent me a long email with external links (for reference) interspersed with the text. Every single time I click an external link  I have to take extra steps to return to reading the email - extra steps that wouldn't have been necessary with a back button. Honestly  navigating between apps using the home button makes about as much sense to me as cooking a dish  and exiting and re-entering the kitchen every time I want to add a different ingredient.

**It is unintuitive.** This is my biggest pet peeve because Apple keeps marketing their products as intuitive and easy to use.

Most phones come with a 'back' button that works in *every* situation. It will either take you to the previous menu  or back to the previous app you were using  or back to your home screen. Since there is no 'back' button on iPhones  the 'back' function is worked into the apps  on screen. In most apps  you can find the 'back' button in the top left corner. However  there are many cases in which this isn't the case:

- In Safari  the back button is at the bottom (and you need to scroll upwards for it to even appear).

- When viewing directions in Googlemaps  if you want to return to the map view  you need to 'swipe' the directions out of the way.

- In some apps (Gmail for example)  there's no quick way to go back. Say I've checked my inbox and then go to check my spam folder  there is no back button onscreen at all - I need to manually tap 'my folders' and tap 'inbox' from there.

In other words  while in a majority of cases I know that I can find a 'back' button at the top left of the screen  there are also numerous examples where this isn't the case  and there are many situations in which I would need to 'learn' how to do an extremely simple command ('go back').

You might say that these are small inconveniences that no longer are relevant once you get used to it. But the fact remains that they are easily fixed with the addition of a universal 'back' button  and that it is an especially bad design choice for a company like Apple which claims to value intuitive design.

------------------------

Whenever I bring this up in real-world conversation  my friends are quick to point out that Apple's sales show that most people have no problem with the design of the iPhone. I concede that this is true; however  I would like to hear from you guys your views on how:

- The lack of a back button is not a bad thing  or how

- It's a bad thing  but you've learnt to tolerate it because of (reason).

CMV please!

CMV: I think I could kill a fully grown Walrus in hand-to-hand combat,"The fight would occur in the Roman Coliseum  flat terrain and no water.

I would be fighting a normal walrus  it wouldn't know a fight was on until it was tasting my nikes.

Some of my friends think it's ridiculous  but I feel like a Walrus would not stand a chance against me. Walruses are just so slow.

My current strategy would be getting behind the Walrus and clambering on it's back. From here I could deliver head stomps and gouge out it's eyes. It would take a while but eventually the Walrus would surely die. I know the Walrus would try to stab me with tusks  but because of the low agility of the Walrus  the tusk attacks would be very easy to dodge. Also I know the Walrus has 'blubber' but I still think my head stomps would rattle it's brain a good amount. Blubber is not a carbon fibre body armour  it's just blubber folks.

I think people overestimate almost all animals fighting ability and I think humans are better fighters than what we get credit for. Humans are just so much smarter than every animal. This Walrus has no strategy  he has a big fat body and long teeth.

Also don't send me a video of a Walrus goring a Polar Bear and act like that's proof. Human vs Walrus folks.

CMV: Using CSS or other means to disable the downvote button is just another form of vote manipulation and should be stopped.,"Vote manipulation to me means any method of changing the vote count on a post other than a legitimate user having an opinion on a post and voting accordingly. This can be done in any direction  up or down. By preventing people from clicking the downvote button in subreddits with CSS  you are causing some people to not vote because they do not want to upvote  and they can't downvote due to the button missing. This is clearly changing the vote count and therefore is vote manipulation in the positive direction  but still vote manipulation.

I'm sure some people will say ""but they can disable CSS or user mobile!"". This is true and I will admit it is a solution  but to me it's not good enough. I'm sure a certain amount of people (myself included) disable CSS on subreddits simply for the ability to downvote. But since a large amount of people don't want to lose CSS permanently  a large amount of would-be downvotes are lost.

It just seems unethical and almost ""safe space""-esque to disable the downvote button in any way. What  if any  legitimate reason could a subreddit have for disabling the downvote button?

CMV: I think Wall-E is the most plausible dystopian future for the human species. (Not 1984),"I am only half kidding when I say that  but at the same time  I would make perfect sense to me. I know a lot of people like to throw out '1984' or 'A Brave New World' as possibilities for a dystopian future. However  to me  I think with global warming  social interactions and obesity being as prevalent as they are... Well  you see where I am going. 
For those of you who are out of the loop  Wall-E is about humans embarking into space after trashing our planet. Generations in space left their bone mass to near nothing  and their BMI off the charts. They never talk to each other  instead they spend all of their time in front of a screen  much like now. All the characters are obese  and they get around their space ship by moving chairs. At the end of the film  the captain is applauded for just standing up. 
Now  in my only 25 years of life  and having lived most of my life in the US  I can see this panning out now. More than two-thirds of Americans are over-weight or obese. On average  Americans watch 5 hours and 4 minutes of TV daily (according to the New York Times). Now  all of us living on a space ship with cute little robots might be a stretch  but we are getting fatter and we put in our screen time.
Lastly  and in my opinion  the saddest part of the movie is the lack of social interactions. Again  I am 25 and American. Not that I am saying I am an old timer  but it does seem as though we spend more time in isolation in front of a screen. I remember as a kid  my parents and a lot of my friends parents almost forbid us from spending all our time inside. My parents had me in as many sports  activities and gatherings as they felt it would help my social development. Did it? Na  I hate people. But still  they tried. 
MY nephew and niece (10 and 5  respectively) spend ALLLLLL DAMMMMNN DAYYYY in front of a screen. They are still pretty thin  as when I baby sit those little monster I take them to the park to burn off energy. My niece's friend's parents (sorry  that is a mouth full) don't do that. They are chubby  anti-social  little kids. It honestly hurts my heart. But  I feel this is our future. For the love that is holy  please CMV. Even though I don't really like kids  I really want them all to be happy and healthy. I really do believe they are our future  and all I want for our species is happiness and prosperity. I just think we aren't on the right path.
TLDR; I think we are getting fat  anti-social and are destroying our planet. I think we might end up like Wall-E  minus the spaceship.

CMV: Celebrity AMAs are ruined by Victoria from Reddit,"**EDIT: [Please read this from the /r/IAmA  mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/30ea3g/mod_post_riama_misconceptions/)**

----

I have no problem with Victoria herself  just the concept of ""Victoria from reddit is here helping me out"".

To me the entire point of an AMA is having someone of note interact
with this unpredictable medium.  Ask Me **Anything**.  It's fun and interesting to see them negotiate the comments  with the potential for them to be reading the most bizarre and funny points of view  with strange interactions on lower voted comments as well as random replies to far reaching child-comments.

Victoria from Reddit turns the medium into yet another ""send in your questions and we'll pick the best to ask this person who is so much better than you"".  Instead of interacting directly with someone  there's a filter.  A filter who types the same way in every AMA  using *italics* and -laughs- and -umms- which completely takes away from it for me.

Here Victoria says that the Woody Harelson AMA would have turned out differently:  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/ck91rpw  Which shows that comments are being filtered.  That is what made AMAs so great  it's a celeb being talked to directly  and this is more often POSITIVE rather than that negative example.

In essence I think Victoria turns it into a basic interview with fan questions that has been done a million times before.  If a brand wants to promote via AMA  jump in and get dirty.   I don't even read AMAs anymore if it's got Victoria doing the typing.

If there's a better way of looking at this   please CMV  I want to enjoy AMAs again without the frustration.

-----
Reason for view change:

I still dislike AMAs with Victoria  and am clearly not the only one.  This comes from Victoria creating a difference between the celebs and us average Joes.  Of course this isn't always the case.  As it turns out  Victoria will help anyone that fits in her schedule.  So in reality it is just some AMAs (Ludacris as a recent example) that may turn out far more interesting if they had to navigate the website themselves in exchange for publicity.

With a few people commenting with first hand experience  I've decided that because the benefits of Victoria are more heavily weighted by the majority  my post title view has been changed.  Even if I'm stuck hating the AMAs  Victoria doesn't ""ruin"" them.

Thanks for all the replies!

"CMV: Most posts to CMV are a bid to be heard, not a request to ""change my view""","I think we ache to be heard  and CMV is a devil's bargain: in exchange for fulfilling the need to be heard  we offer our mind up to be operated on by language.

Changing one's view is actually a somewhat painful process--learning new information is hard  feeling empathy for someone else is exhausting  admitting to a wrong or incomplete view is discouraging  and opening one's ideas to vulnerable cross examination is frightening.

What most of us actually want (and need) is to be heard in the complete sense--to know that someone else understands the context and specifics of our suffering (whether great or small). We yearn to ""feel felt"" by someone. Having one's mind changed in the process is simply the associated cost of venturing out to have this need met.

**Note:** I created /r/ihearyou as an experiment along these lines.

CMV: In 40 years people will think of superhero movies the way we think of westerns from the 60s/70s today,"They just seem so generic and formulaic to me. Even watching some of the better-rated ones from this year (Wonder Woman  Spiderman)  it just feels like they aren't offering anything new  and all follow the same formula like all the Western movies did. Maybe 2-3 of them will stand the test of time (e.g. The Good the Bad and the Ugly  Fistfull of Dollars  Dark Knight  etc.)  but the vast majority will be largely forgotten.

Obviously  it's really hard to predict what media from today will ""stand the test of time"" and be celebrated 40-50 years from now. I'm curious to hear what everyone thinks about this  but right now I believe the big superhero movies will be largely forgotten once the trend passes.

CMV: I see no reason why men's and women's chess are separate events.,"Sure  sex segregation makes a lot of sense for many sports/games where men might have an advantage due to physiological differences.

But chess is purely mental. There is no need for strength  speed  endurance or any other physiological parameter that would give men an advantage.

In fact  some women do compete successfully in top flight tournaments with men  something that would be impossible in physical sports.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r

If anything  it seems that ""women only"" chess events are sexist  because the implication is that women are not as smart as men.

The totality of several posts convinced me that women only events maybe needed *for now* as a kind of a remedial measure for countering many years of men dominance in chess and the fact that currently women are underrepresented in chess.

CMV: Netflix change their rating system out of greed and tried to make the public think they asked for it.,"I remember just before the swtich  Amy Shumer's Netflix Original Stand-up was getting 1 starred to hell and I have no interest in her comedy. After the switch it showed up in my recommended (or whatever it's called) with high 90's% chance I'd like it.

Bullshit  already after this one instance I'm thinking Netflix is stacking their algorithms in their favor.

I remember Netflix's advertising the change with phrases like  ""You asked and we responded"". I have a hard time believing anything but ""The movie is lagging"" and ""Why did you remove / don't you have ________"" being the only real public concerns.

Now they're defending the move with phrases like ""You can find reviews from other sources""  yeah we can but don't act like you've done the public a big favor my changing it to the still very wrong system.

Before  Netflix was great for me. I'd pick a genre that I liked and 9 times out of 10 if a show had 4+ stars  I ended up liking it.

Now I have way more misses  and I have to resort to using rotten tomatoes which didn't jive with me as well as Netflix star system.

Edit: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMliusRrr90) is a piece of evidence to consider that Netflix has manipulated the rating system.

CMV: Apple is a deceptive company that relies primarily on brand image to sell its overpriced products.,"Apple Inc. used to be a pioneer of technology in the late 20th century with the Macintosh computer and iPod devices  but today they have become a company that relies on inferior rehashes of old technology that they deem as ""innovative"" and market for much more than what they are actually worth. 

A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack. Removing a smartphone component and replacing it with wireless earbuds that are much easier to misplace  AND requiring the user to purchase a separate lightning-to-3.5mm adapter that costs $10 and is described as ""fragile"" and ""poorly made"". One could say that this is intentional and forces the user to spend more money to replace these parts once they break or are lost. 

Now let's look at the software. Mac OS is exclusive to Apple products  which forces me to pick up one of their $2000+ Macbooks if I want to even touch their operating system. People often say that Mac is better for developers than Windows  but having used Windows  OS X  and Linux  I can say with certainty that OS X is the least capable of the three. The amount of available software that can run on OS X is minimal compared to Windows. For developers  Linux is superior  with greater customization and an enormous online community for help (as opposed to having to contact Apple tech support). And the best part? Linux is FREE.

Compatibility between hardware and software is also an issue. Apple has specifically designed it such that their devices will only function with THEIR equipment. Want to add some songs to your iPhone? Better open up iTunes! Need a new cable? Time to go the Apple Store!

But people will still buy it  because it's Apple  after all. They want to walk around with their fancy white earbuds and their Apple-branded bottles and T-shirts. The company has done such a great job at establishing their brand image over the last few decades that they can send out overpriced  mediocre products and still make money. People are so distracted by the brand that they fail to see this. Apple knows that they will always have dedicated consumers who throw money at them  and as a result  they no longer feel the need to innovate when they can recycle the same concepts year after year. 

EDIT: After reading some responses  probably the one that changed my view the most was that if a person sees an item as being valuable  they are justified in spending money on it. In this case  the demand for an Apple product is not so much the brand image as it is the perceived uses of the product from the perspective of that person. Therefore it is not ""overpriced"" if people *are* willing to pay that much for it. 

Anyway  these comments have provided some new perspective for me. I probably won't get through all the responses but you can consider my view at least somewhat changed. :)

CMV: We should no longer be buried in cemeteries or caskets when we die.,"From what I understand  caskets or coffins were used to keep the body locked in when people thought they might possibly come back from the dead and crawl their way back up to the surface as some type of zombie. Also  to stop grave robbers from stealing organs or items that the deceased was buried with. 
It seems completely insane to me to spend thousands of dollars on a wooden box just to be buried 6 feet under  never to be seen again. Then spend another few thousand dollars on a gravestone and another on a plot in a cemetery. If everyone chooses to be buried like this  the whole planet would eventually be one giant cemetery. 
Being buried in a casket with a gravestone marking your spot seems completely selfish to me. Not only because the fact that the thousands of dollars spent could have gone to better use but  I_ feel like the majority of people take from the planet more than they try to preserve it. The least we could do when we die is be buried without a box and let the nutrients from our remains go back into the earth. Or get cremated and have our ashes spread somewhere. Having a gravestone above your burial site makes it seem like you want to be remembered as someone important. WeÕre only here for a short time  it is up to us to choose the legacy we are going to leave behind. Some people will be remembered for a very long time through generations and others will be remembered by only a few. The life we choose to live will determine that. 
IÕm not saying that only some people deserve to be remembered but  thatÕs just how it is. Out of the billions of people on this planet a very small percentage will be remembered for a decent amount of time. But  for some reason  some people think they can have a permanent spot on this planet. As humans weÕre no better than any other species trying to survive here. 
I think we should be past this idea of being buried in an expensive box  in a little area of a cemetery  with a fancy gravestone taking up space.

CMV: The 24 hour clock (military time) is superior to the 12 hour clock.,"I think my reasoning on this one is fairly self explanatory. I feel that it is unnecessarily confusing to refer to the 13th hour of the day as 1 o'clock PM. I feel like the concepts of AM and PM are dated and probably originated from a time where humans were much more dependent on natural sunlight to be productive. With the advent of artificial light noon is no longer really the ""middle"" of the workday so I see no reason to reset the clock and start counting from one again every time we hit noon.

CMV: People who drive loud cars and motorcycles are inconsiderate assholes,"It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet.  
  
I've always found them annoying  say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  
  
I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently  and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  
  
It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud  not a necessity. On top of that  the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  
  
These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.

***EDIT:***   
  
I had no idea this post would get this big and  as much as I'd like to  I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone  on both sides of the issue  for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  
  
The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle  and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well  so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.
  
My favorite arguments were those along the lines of ""It's a free country  you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent."" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming ""IM BEING OPPRESSED"" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.  A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much.
  
I also learned that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all!  
  
***EDIT 2:*** 
  
/u/ToastitoTheBandito did manage to change my view on this. [Here is the link to his comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bfrve/cmv_people_who_drive_loud_cars_and_motorcycles/csmj6kc)  Thank you Toastito  and thank you for being considerate to others.
  
Just a caveat here  there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it  people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   
  
I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. **But this post isn't JUST about me  or my baby.** These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts  each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. **People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.**  
  
One PM I got said:  
  
>I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  
  
He doesn't take the time to think  ""How will my actions affect those around me?

CMV: Cupcakes are vastly overrated,"While the ""Cupcake Craze"" of the early 2010s has lessened  there are still a number of residual holdouts  peddling their ""gourmet"" cupcakes for $5. Here in Chicago  there are Molly's  Sprinkles  Magnolia Bakery  The Cupcake Counter  and countless other self-indulgent cupcake hellholes. They are a symbol of the vast marketing done by Big Cupcake to make us believe that cupcakes are a superior dessert. They sit among the cookie  the cake  and the pie in great American desserts. However  such a statement is a lie and cupcakes  while tasty  are overrated due to (1) inefficient taste delivery  (2) irregular proportions  (3) messiness  and (4) overrated convenience. These 4 points are not exclusive  but cover the basic reasons why cupcakes do not deserve the laud and attention they currently entertain.


Original Position: A cupcake is a cake based dessert that consist of cake batter placed in ridged  paper cups  baked in a specific pan with holes. The cake batter bakes until it overflows the hole and is then frosted/decorated on top before being served. [Image for reference](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwj7mf2FnoHTAhUB2oMKHck8CXUQjBwIBA&url=https%3A%2F%2Flittlecupcakes.com.au%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F05%2FRed-Velvet.png&psig=AFQjCNF9SOJh_Wcv326CevPTlOPv4z0BRg&ust=1491066591735089). Furthermore  the purpose of a cupcake is to be a more efficient delivery system of cake that can also be individualized.


1. **Inefficient Taste Delivery:** In appearance  a cupcake make sense as a individualized cake. However  the delivery of frosting and cake is inefficient as the structure of a cupcake makes it impossible to taste the cake and frosting evenly. The generally accepted method of biting a cupcake is to pinch the sides of the stump  open one's mouth  and then bite down through the frosting and up through the cake. This supposedly avoids the messiness of grabbing the frosting while still allowing a person to eat the cupcake with his/her hands. Some may bite the frosting or cake first  but those people are fucked in the head. However  the inherent design of a cupcake makes it impossible to deliver an even taste. Instead  the biter distinctly tastes frosting on the roof of his mouth and cake on his tounge. In contrast  other handheld foods  like a sandwich or burger  addresses this issue by encasing the center filling (meat  cheese  condiments  etc) with bread allowing every bite to be even in how the varying tastes are delivered. Some have suggested that you can rip the stump off to put it on top of the cupcake  but this only proves my point that the natural design of a cupcake is flawed and therefore it is overrated as a dessert.


2. **Irregular Proportions:** The inherent design flaw of cupcakes leads to my next point: the irregular proportions and delivery. Cupcakes  especially gourmet ones  have gotten excessive in their proportions of frosting to cake. While cakes normally adhere to a range of frosting depth  current cupcakes can range from .5"" to 3"" of frosting on top. This [picture](http://sugarywinzy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SugaryWinzy-Spring-Cupcakes-with-Fat-Free-Frosting.jpg) alone shows how ridiculous it can get. It is not standardized in any way can leave you with either too much sweet frosting or too little depending on the one you get. Added to the already 3-5"" stump  you're also looking at possibly an 8"" bite. Unless you can unhinge your jaw  such a is ridiculous. As a result  you will always receive irregular proportions of frosting and cake as you try to tilt the cupcake for a bite. Such proportions show that the cupcake is overrated as a dessert. 


3. **Messiness:** The fucked up proportions of current cupcakes causes the next point: messiness. Cupcakes appear to be a cleaner alternative to your average cake. It's handheld  contained in a paper wrapping  and solid enough to be turned upside now and not collapse or fall apart. However  to anyone who has eaten a cupcake  they understand that the paper wrapping becomes more of a hindrance than a help. Once pulled down  the wrapping either blocks the bite  rubs the bottom of the chin with its dirtiness  or gets completely removed for better cupcake eating. But once removed  the wrapper is now useless waste  much like a plate except that unlike a plate  the wrapper can no longer catch the crumbs from each bite. Instead they fall to the floor or your hand. Additionally  the frosted top  often too big to consume in one bite  will brush the upper lip or nose leaving frosting residue. As a result  you are left with cake crumbs on your hands and frosting on your face. Thus messiness.


4. **Overrated Convenience:** The messiness of the cupcake supports the final point: the overrated convenience of a cupcake. A cupcake is intended to be a more convenient cake. Yet  it leaves you with the same messiness and garbage a slice of cake would. Coupled with the inefficient delivery of fucked up proportions  the convenience of eating a cupcake is made minute if not non-existent. Additionally  if making your own  the individualized nature of each cupcake destroys the convenience of the cupcake. Both baking  frosting  and cleaning are exponentially increased in time and effort so as to render any future convenience worthless.


As it stands  the cupcake should be relegated to novelty desserts that while tasty  are inherently flawed by their design.



So I ask you to change my view on the inferiority of the cupcake and its overrated position in the dessert pantheon.


Edit: Thanks so much for the comments. It's making a slow day go by quick. I'm still of the opinion that cupcakes are vastly overrated despite their inherent design flaws and underwhelming eating experience. But I need to get some work done  so I'll be taking a break from responding. Please continue discussing and fight against Big Cupcake!

CMV: I believe most people (including myself) don't know enough about the economy and politics to debate politics.,"My friends and I occasionally debate politics when we hang out and as much as I enjoy it  I don't believe there is always so much information out there that none of us can know enough to be able to be confident in what we're saying.  For the record  I do have a basic idea of what I'm saying.  I realize the Daily Show and Colbert Report aren't exactly hard news shows but I do watch both of those consistently  I listen to npr and economics podcasts  I read articles online that I can find to educate myself but I *still* feel like unless I'm spending hours a day researching  I have no idea what I'm talking about and shouldn't have arguing in favor of anything more complex than gay marriage (which doesn't even get debated).

TL;DR - I feel like unless I spend hours a day researching politics and economics  I'm not qualified enough to have a strong political opinion and I have no right to argue for a position.  Please CMV so I don't feel like an idiot.

CMV: Fliptop toothpaste caps are universally better than screwtop caps,"After buying a new brand of toothpaste (Crest) because it was on sale instead of my usual brand (Colgate)  I was horrified to find that it came with a screwtop cap. After using it for a week  it's obvious that fliptop caps are universally better than screwtop caps and there should be no reason for screwtop capped toothpaste to remain on the market.

Benefits of fliptop:

* It's faster to open.
* It can be opened one handed  leaving the other hand to hold the toothbrush.
* You don't have to find a place to put the screwtop while brushing your teeth.
* You don't risk the top falling down the drain and being lost forever.
* For households with young children  the screwtop is a potential choking hazard.
* Screwtops require much better hand-eye co-ordination to close which can be challenging first thing in the morning.

In short  screwtops are worse in every single way than fliptops and deserve to die a fiery death.

"CMV: caffeine content of beverages should have to clearly displayed on the front of the bottle like alcohol content on beer, wine, and spirits.","Caffeine is a drug that is often overlooked and it's negative effects genreally glossed over in our society. Clearly it's not as bad as alcohol and not needed to calculate a ""safe"" dose in the case of caffeine but cleaclearly labeling the caffeine content will allow people to see how much caffeine they ingest at a glance. Many people are not aware of how much caffeine is in soda and often get addicted to caffeine without realizing it is happeneing. I think that one of the reasons beverage companies use caffeine in many drinks is to get people hooked on that beverage. Many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep. Caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine. Overall I think adding the content will help because it subliminaly shows people that caffeine is a drug and should be treated like it while increasing consumer awareness and choice while also not discouraging or inconvenienceing anyone who chooses to use caffeine.

"CMV: Hard times create strong men, Strong men create good times, Good times create weak men, Weak men create hard times.","Let's put this in the context of history to be specific  for example  times when governments with authoritative policies are put into power when the previous government (usually a democracy) is destabilized. Alternatively  when an authoritative government (which was meant to keep things in order) starts becoming too oppressive people will eventually start fighting for a more democratic one to replace it. 

I also think that wars/death/suffering are inevitable when this process is taking place. As long as resources are finite and people are different there will be no end to conflict thus keeping the cycle happening.

My professor said that perhaps the wars and other conflicts need not happen  that maybe we can live in a world of perpetual good times and strong people and break the ""cycle"" suggesting that there might be a solution to this. I on the other hand think that this philosophy is an essential part to the human experience  to learn the importance of struggle and the foolishness of being contented is not something you can just write down and teach the younger generation. It's something that they themselves have to experience as well which is why history keeps repeating itself.

That said  it ain't easy defending skipping as the most underutilized  underappreciated  and underrated form of human travel due to it's ostracization throughout history. One quick example is noted in JRR Tolkien historic novella  ""Lord of the Rings "" as the orcs  the bad guys  NEVER skip (no citations needed). Not once. That's why they're so angry: because they never experienced the magic of skipping. And that's why we went to war: lack of skipping. If they had skipped into battle then they would've canceled the war altogether and ate lembas bread and watch Gandalf shoot fireworks. The middle ages would've be a better place. Therefore  skipping is more than just an efficient form of travel: it's an opportunity to change ones lifestyle.

The first lifestyle change lies in the efficiency of skipping  because you're using the power of science to momentum yourself around from Point A to Point B through Z (Z because you saved so much energy from not running that you can actually go all places you couldn't go before). Dan Carlin of Hardcore History notes in his lesson on Alexander the Great that the armies would often times march at a constant pace  and eventually his men were bitter because they were so far from home. If they had skipped  they would've traveled THRICE as far and actually circled the globe and would've been back home already. 

Additionally  skipping helps the heart. It's more functional than other natural movements. Walking is lumberous  crawling hurts on sidewalk  moonwalking is too slow  and running makes you elitist and then you spend money on shoes and heartrate monitors and eventually you leave for some triathlete. But skipping would never do that  because skipping doesn't cheat. Skipping doesn't lie. Skipping doesn't hurt. Skipping is an opportunity to feel again. It lets you feel the wind upon your face after nights alone in the dark. Skipping let's you feel like you're going places and not stuck in second gear all the time. It let's you feel like there's more to life than just... being left behind. Skipping makes you feel alive  again. 

Next in line for the True Facts Report on this vehicle of the human body is that skipping fills your body with joy. It's what the Grinch should've done to originally make his heart grow three sizes bigger  because it makes even the most curmudgeonly of folk feel better about life. A man once said  ""motion changes **e**motion."" The body can't help but release chemicals whilst skipping  causing us to feel elation  euphoria  excitement  and excitement  and other e-words. 

Lastly  it's contagious. You throw in a bit of whistling and some arm back-and-forth and you got yourself a regular ole ballyhoo that others will see as an opportunity to shed their blanket bitterness against life and actually do something to curb their frustrations. It's a physical activity that others can't help but join in  like a Conga Line or a spontaneous riot. Imagine the streets filled with skipping whistlers  with men who dream  with folks who actually care again. Men  women  and elderly locked arms and skipping  whistling show tunes and making life a better place to be.

Not only is skipping the most underutilized and unappreciated form of human travel  but it's opportunity to be happy again  and that's why it's the most underrated form of travel.

CMV:Any fat person can lose weight by simply adjusting their diet and exercise.,"I have hypothyroidism  PCOS  and used to be a emotional binge eater. I lost over 60lbs. I understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight  but considering I have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one  and still lost weight. I just don't understand.

I'm starting to look at fat loss as simply a matter of accepting that your diet is flawed and making changes. People have false views of how healthy they eat and this pride prevents them from making changes they need. 

Everytime I post something like this I just get a million downvotes. Why do people downvote me? Is it because I'm wrong somehow and millions of people truly can't lose weight.

Edit: Okay it makes more sense. ""Simply"" being a troubled word that implies weight loss is easy. That was incorrect.

 I was obese as a child and lost the weight when I grew old enough to buy and prepare my own food. I'm blessed with a preference for the healthy food and slowly taught myself to lower my appetite  making my experience easier than most. I shouldn't project myself so much on other people.

No one is arguing thermodynamics or saying weight loss is impossible. Everyone is saying that it is hard and after varies arguments I'm inclined to agree.

However  while weight loss is hard due to various factors  they do have solutions. ex: An emotional eater can indivually work out their food addiction. While it isn't easy  it can be done. I can't settle for ""can't"". I feel like that is too dismissive and hopeless. 

But it is a matter of willpower. The debate is whether people can control their willpower. It is also a matter of wanting to lose weight. Settling for being overweight is a choice a lot of people seem to make. But I guess its sort of the same thing as smoking. Something in theory can be fixed by putting down the cigarette but a ton of inner strife.

But in all seriousness  for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them (I forgot to mention I'm a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors. Nutrition actually has little classes on psychology and weight loss  and mostly cooking and science classes. I sorta rely on reddit to educate myself.

How can weight loss become easier? What can I do? What can society do? Etc

Also  I'm kinda hung up on few things. I feel like while people may not want to  pretty much every condition can be overcome. With the exception of people with extremely low BMRs where the subsequent nutrient defences and hunger pangs outweigh the benefits of wright loss.

So I guess my view has been partially changed. So like ""half deltas all around"". When I figure out how to give a delta I will award particularly thought provoking comments. 

Edit 2: oh I forgot to mention I never ever condone bullying or shaming fat people. The never directly tell people they should lose weight. From when I was fat ""my mirror tells me I'm fat everyday  I don't need to hear it from anyone else""

CMV: I believe that Elisabeth Moss and her connection to Scientology undermines the social importance of The Handmaids Tale.,"Scientology is a cult that suppresses women and it is a corrupt organized business disguising itself as a religion. 

Currently there is a moment to take the organization down through documentaries and the Leah Remini specials. 

Elisabeth Moss is a member of Scientology and because of this she should not have been castes as her role in The Handmaids Tale  a story about how women's rights are human rights and that oppression must always be fought. 

Her mere presence ruins the message of this story by having someone who supports such a heinous organization at its forefront.

CMV: Devices incapable of hovering should not be permitted to call themselves hoverboards.,"A hoverboard is a well-known science fiction trope: a skateboard-sized device that can float above solid surfaces and is used for personal transportation and recreation.  

Today there exist some modified Segway bases that call themselves hoverboards despite the fact that they are entirely incapable of hovering.  If anything  they are less capable of spending time aloft than a standard skateboard.  However  their name causes confusion among potential purchasers and may mislead us into obtaining one despite the lack of the advertised capability.  Worse yet  if they become popular and retain this name  they may poison the original term and make great science fiction works like Back to the Future less accessible to future generations.

For these reasons  the devices should not be allowed to advertise themselves as Hoverboards.  Self-balancing boards or Headless Segways would be more reasonable.  

I understand that Patmont Motor Werks has registered a trademark on the term hoverboard for two wheeled scooters; this is not the source of my objection.  Also  their trademark should be sharply limited to ensure that actual hoverboard manufacturers can call their products hoverboards without legal difficulty.

CMV: Daylight Savings Time is a Complete Waste of Energy and Time and should be Removed.,"As I understand it  Daylight savings time is pointless and even occasionally dangerous. On days after the time switch  studies show that there are more car crashes and other accidents because people are behind on sleep.  
Nor does it effectively save energy  because when Indiana went on Daylight savings in the 90s  energy use actually increased. Daylight savings originated at the beginning of the 20th century when energy use and people's habits of sleeping were completely different.  
Finally  since the majority of the world does not use daylight savings  DS makes it more inconvenient for countries to communicate  trade  and travel. 
I have a hard time thinking of any positive aspects of DST  and if there are  surely they are outweighed by the many negatives.

CMV: Being unpleasant to opponents in discussions of controversial topics is never a good idea if your position really matters to you,"I have been on both sides of the political spectrum throughout my adult life. I was conservative at first  thanks to absorbing years of right wing talk radio around my super conservative dad. I absorbed not just the viewpoints but also the combative and insulting delivery of those viewpoints. So  when later introduced to the Internet and its swamps of political discourse  I dove right in and acted just like a Swamp creature towards commies and libtards and the like. 

I did  eventually  change just about all my views. Went from W. Bush to Bernie Sanders  where I presently feel most comfortable  politically speaking. It wasn't any ugly liberal invective which changed me but life experience. What didn't change was my propensity to engage opponents from a bad place. People who had views exactly like those I once had were now enemies to be defeated. And there is a visceral kind of thrill when you actually do manage to shut such a person down with the right amount of bile and  what seems on the surface  a well-reasoned rhetorical thrust. 

You really can't find many better examples of a worthless victory. If I affected any change in anybody doing this  it was to make myself look like an asshole to anybody who isn't doing exactly the same thing I am doing  and for sure  my 'enemy' has only entrenched further into beliefs I find abhorrent. 

It is easy to insult a person and it does provide a base thrill. It does satisfy something animal in the heart. It also contributes to the erosion of intelligent discourse and the dehumanization of people who are mostly like you but for differing views. And it only hurts whatever cause you want to promote. 

Ask questions. Give a person the benefit of the doubt. Having a bad opinion doesn't mean the person is bad or wants to make others suffer. Learn about what makes them afraid and you will learn why it makes them angry. Share your experiences and empathize. 

And if it doesn't work  move on.

CMV: Fonts that have ambiguous lower case L and uppercase I should be phased out from use.,"Some of the most popular fonts today (Arial  Helvetica  etc) are ambiguous. I can thus spell IIIinois without using the letter L  and it will slip by completely unnoticed.

Why is this a serious problem?

Aside from the core value of having a discrete set of symbols to represent our written communication system (ie alphabet)  the ambiguity can also lead to some serious problems. In computer security  usernames and websites can now be spoofed by this simple trick (eg by pointing someone to hotmaiI.com rather than to hotmail.com). Passwords may become confused or lost due to this simple affect as well.

We should therefore eschew these fonts. Since I know we won't  I really do want you to CMV.

CMV: It's dumb to form an opinion if you don't know enough about that subject,"A little inspired by a [ELI5 request](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7bobz7/eli5_nietzsches_view_on_the_truth/) I did a few days ago about what Nietzsche thought about the truth.

It drives me crazy to see this. I find very stupid of people with little to none information about something creating their own thoughts about something that they are not necessarily right. Not exactly the best example I could think of but here it is.

Person A watched a 2 hour movie and loved it. Now he wants to show it to person B  but person B just watched 15 minutes of it and hated it. Now person B thinks the movie sucks and thinks he is right about it.

"CMV: Math Was Invented, Not Discovered","My math teachers have said on multiple occasions ""math was discovered  not invented "" but I'm not sure I believe that. 

Sure  math is able to very accurately describe certain phenomena in the real world  but that doesn't mean it is itself a natural thing. We simply created something that worked to describe the real world's effects.

For example  take language. I *think* most people agree that humans invented English  and it's still able to describe things in the world. Just off the top of my head  sunsets have been around for all of history. Does that mean that we discovered the word ""sunset?"" I don't think so. I think it just means that we created something that is then used to describe the real world phenomena of a sunset. 

Isn't it the same for math? Sure  moving fluids will follow equations that can be found from fluid dynamics and a curve will have the slope designated to it by calculus  but I think we simply created math to be able to relate the two-- not that mathematics is an inherent universal quality that humans simply stumbled upon. No  I think one day someone said ""Hey  if I designate numerals to certain things in the real world and manipulate them a certain way  it predicts what will happen pretty accurately.""

Maybe this is just a matter of semantics of ""discover"" and ""invent "" but I'm hoping you guys can shed a little more light on this for me  and maybe even change my view. 

Edit: I'm getting a ton of useful replies  and I don't have time right now to read them all  but I promise I will and I will award deltas to the best answers  but I can confidently say that my view has been (at least somewhat) changed. Math was discovered in that the relationships it explains are always there  we just needed to find the working of mathematics that explain it (I think that's the gist of what most of you are saying).

CMV: I donÕt pee in the shower because thereÕs a toilet right there and I have bladder control. Why is it such a widely accepted thing to do this? Most people tend to disagree with me when it comes up in conversation.,"My view is that the shower is for getting clean  not peeing in  so as an average adult  either pee before you get in  step out for a second  or hold it like a grown-up for a few minutes. The presence of a drain and plumbing that all goes to the same place isnÕt a foolproof answer because we have a sink and drain in other areas of the house  but you donÕt see me shitting in the kitchen just because I can.

In the words of Chris Rock: ÒYou could drive a car with your feet if you really wanted to. That doesnÕt mean itÕs to be done.Ó

My wife and friends hold the opposite (and IÕm assuming majority) view  in that itÕs acceptable to pee in the shower.

CMV: It's ridiculous to be offended by a rape scene in a show (Game of Thrones) that features a violent murder almost every episode,"I'll try not to spoil anything here for people who haven't watched Game of Thrones  but this post is specifically about events in that show. So if you don't watch it  or intend to  perhaps this is a good time to skedaddle.

[Tonight's episode featured a rape scene.](/sp) I Googled 'game of thrones rape' to find that within an hour of the episode airing  several prominent publications had already posted articles with titles like 'Did Game of Thrones go too far?' 'Was that rape scene necessary?' etc. etc. I don't even want to check Twitter because I have a feeling it's full of the same.

A rape scene! Outrage! When will rape culture stop!? GoT went too far!

Yet the show also depicts HUNDREDS  literally HUNDREDS of murders. Murders of babies. Murders of parents in front of the children. Casual murder. There was a murder of an unborn child in one episode. 

Yet the only reaction people have to those is that ""they miss that character"" or ""OMG I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.""

**HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT SAYING:** I'm not saying that rape is acceptable  or that we should just sit back and enjoy it when it's depicted on film. That scene was hard as hell to watch. I'm also not saying that we should be outraged that Game of Thrones (or any show for that matter) is ultra violent and depicts so much murder. 

But I think it's absurd to get worked up about a show depicting something terrible (rape) while totally ignoring that it constantly depicts something that is  in my opinion  worse (murder). 

Change my view.

EDIT: I guess I need to clarify a bit  as lots of people have posted regarding what it means to be ""offended""/""outraged."" I have no problem with people being personally offended by something  either because it invokes a memory  or they simple find it difficult to sit through. To clarify my position  being offended by something  and then taking to the internet to say that the show's creators were WRONG to show it  is ridiculous. 

Example of what I'm talking about (scroll down for Twitter reactions as well):
[here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/11612290/rape-game-of-thrones.html)

**EDIT 2: Really wish I had worded things better  but it's fine  I think it still made for a good discussion. I'm gonna stop responding to most things now  because I think enough people share my view that I'm not necessarily needed. Also  I do apologize if this ruffled any feathers or brought up any rough memories for anyone--it's always challenging to discuss rape in a careful yet constructive way  so I hope it went that way for the most part. Thanks all!**

CMV: The 12 Steps are utterly ineffective for a large fraction of people and their near monopoly in addiction treatment is bad for everyone,"I'll be straight forward with you: while I believe a good deal of 12 step related therapy is smart and useful  I believe the system as a whole is deeply flawed and ineffective  and that it is usually the only treatment option is practically criminal and is cancerous to society. I have personal experience with it of course  and obviously that is important to my view  but please refrain any ad hominem accusations as they are cheap and irrelevant to the actual issue.


Most people know that abstinence based education is  depending on the issue somewhat  just a bad idea for a general sample of individuals. Sure it works fantastic for some  but to others more prone to the allure of concupiscence (the ""forbidden fruit"" effect)  myself included here  it is backwards and can even make things worse. For those of you who simply never break rules because rules are rules  you should consider forming a less intellectually bankrupt foundation for your actions (there I said it!).


Abstinence is the cornerstone of the 12 step program  to the extent that teaching people how to snap out of a relapse or ""slip"" is virtually ignored despite this being obviously crucial. Everything about AA/NA programs is geared towards creating the perception that your DoC (drug of choice) is impossibly addictive to you (not necessarily others though)  that you never had even the slightest bit of control  will never have it  and that if you try your DoC after getting clean  you will almost certainly be  for lack of a better term  fucked.


It should be obvious why this is a completely irresponsible thing to tell people who have a pretty good chance of ""relapsing"" at some point.


In AA/NA everyone is treated nearly the same as well. I had a problem with opiates. I have never even had a slight problem with alcohol because in many ways I detest it and find it to be toxic bordering on masochistic. But  I was told that because I had a problem with opiates  I could not EVER DRINK ALCOHOL AGAIN. I ignored this nonsense of course  and  unsurprisingly  my very moderate use of alcohol **has not changed in the slightest.** Nor will it ever change. I know that is presumptuous  but I know it's true  I simply don't like alcohol anywhere near enough to want to do it more than once or twice a week at the most. It's utter poison  rots your insides  and is  in my opinion  a drug for people much  much *stupider* than me  stupider than you too I'm sure.


The reason why abstinence is  in this case  a dreadful policy for most people has a lot to do with the fact that addicts are  as rule almost  always people who are very prone to concupiscence. Exaggerating the allure and danger of their DoC is probably the worse thing you can do in many cases. The truth is  usually addicts *already know exactly how dangerous their DoC is*  and if they don't they hear people's stories and find out fast. It's completely artificial and wrong to exaggerate the dangers of such things when the *truth is sufficient.* Being realistic is much better for everyone.


To make a point  the truth about even the most addictive substances  heroin and morphine  amphetamines like adderall and crystal meth  is that a *large majority of cases people who use them  especially for medical purposes  DO NOT become addicted in the slightest.* Remember these are the *exact same drugs and drug effects * it is a myth that they are entirely different when used for medical purpose  the effects are identical in every way except the intensity. If you did not know heroin is practically identical to morphine in its effect. In fact it is literally is an inactive molecule that is converted to morphine rapidly in your body to work (yes people)  and is often used in place of morphine in the UK  Canada  and elsewhere.


Enormous numbers of people take morphine  diamorphine (heroin)  fentanyl  adderall  etc **everyday** and will **never** develop an addiction. Addictions are easy to get  sure. They don't really require any great lapse in judgment; a few moments of weakness  ignorance  or stupidity is often all it takes to be trapped. It's incredibly naive to think an ex-addict  someone who actually knows the dangers of their DoC better than *anyone * cannot learn moderation. If anything they are especially suited to learning moderation. CMV!


Note: If you are even considering responding with ""you/they just want to continue using drugs"" rather than making a point  you should probably unplug your computer and never go on the internet again. Thank you for your courtesy.

CMV: Basic computer programming should be taught in primary education.,"With the increasing reliance on technology and computer-based daily activities  primary schools should incorporate some sort of programming into the standard curriculum.  I understand that not everyone is supposed to be a programmer  but the logic and reasoning skills developed from learning basic programming skills helps to supplement other areas of learning.  

Programming the most basic software helps developing minds learn to problem solve and work out solutions to basic tasks.  Even if the programming is more centered around seeing the effects of basic functions like using Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/)  this sort of practice will greatly benefit future generations in whichever career path they go down.

CMV: The mother who had an autistic child disrupting a Broadway show is not a hero and is completely selfish.,"Strong statement I know  I'm a bit on edge at the moment so a delta may be easy to acquire later on.

I have autism  fairly low level Aspergers which still means that social cues  sarcasm  empathy  noise  and crowds are a bit distressing  and attending a 3 hour Broadway show where it would be noisy  hot  crowded and boring would be a big no for me at any age.

But I read about a mother that was being ""attacked"" (not physically  but verbally) after her child was freaking out and yelping and screaming halfway though during a really graphic whipping scene that any adult would find distressing let alone a normal child  and let alone a autistic child.

[Link to a report](http://themighty.com/2015/09/broadway-star-makes-passionate-post-after-child-with-autism-disrupts-show/) about how one of the performers defended the mother over the issue. I look at this a think  how did you think it would be a good idea to do this? 

This is unacceptable to me  the kid wasn't 'supposed' to be there  the kid effectively ruined the evening for a lot of people who paid a lot of money to see the show  and the main excuse is ""the kid has autism""  she should have known the kid would react like this and to let it happens shows contempt for the other show goers. 

It's shit like this that continues to make me feel ashamed to have autism since it helps fuel the stigma that everyone with autism will be a disruptive and uncontrollable Rainman.

Please change my view.

EDIT: It's over  an audience of dickheads and a exposure experiment gone awire it what happened here. Thanks /u/JacquesPL1980 and /u/riggorous 

**FINAL EDIT: Thank you for contributing everyone  I won't be reading any more because this discussion has grown large and complex and ^(^it's ^scaring ^me ^slightly). My final stance is that it was inconsiderate of the mother to bring the child but it was a necessary evil to help allow the child to become more ""normal"". The audience were dickheads for being that verbally abusive.**

CMV: The strings that control a window blinds are crappy design.,"I know  cue the **""you're out of ideas"" comments**.

But in general  this is a design choice that pisses me off. Here is my reasoning  and how we could do better:

1) It is really hard to control: Whenever I want the shades to go down  the string locks the shades further up  and when I want them to go up  they fall and won't go back up.

2) Children are really good at ****ing them up: There is the scenerio where the child manages to triangle the blinds  where the one side is much higher than the other. Children love playing with the strings and putting the little cap thingies in their mouths. Believe me  I was a child once  and I did that a lot.

So how do we kill two birds with one stone? Simile  instead of having it controlled by a string that must be manually jolted  change the controls to operate via a wheel. Turn the wheel one way and it would go up  the other way would go down. And it would be sturdy enough to hold up on its own. There it is easier to use  and keeps kids away from where no parents want them.

"CMV: I see no problem with public urination at night in a secluded, grassy, spot, and it should not be illegal.","I'll start this CMV off with a story:

I was at a concert one time at my local college. I had to leave a little early because I had something in the morning. So I was walking to my car and I had the sudden urge to pee  and I had the urge bad. I was parked next to a grassy area with a couple of trees  and it was almost 12 at night with no one around because everyone was either asleep or at the concert. So I peed on a tree  and drive home  that's it. Nobody saw me  not a single cop  kid  or adult.

I had to go bad  and there were no bathrooms around. If there was a porta potty or a bathroom nearby  I would've gone there  but i didn't see one and I had to go bad.

This was not the first time it's happened to me and it probably won't be the last. I can see the issue with sanitation  but if it's on the grass or even on the concrete during a rainy day  what's the problem? It will go away eventually.

It's a natural urge  and I think that if the circumstances are right (dark  crammed up in a corner or made some other effort to hide their private parts)  then they should not get into any legal trouble.

My only problem is how this would apply to girls  which should be self explanatory.

I'd love to see the other side of this and have my view changes!

Edit: wow I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. I'm going to bed now  I'll respond to more in the morning!

Edit 2: so what I've learned is that urine contains nitrogen which helps breakdown things. Which is good for compost  but bad for living things. If We do this in moderation if it's an emergency  then it should be at most a ticket. The chance of being put on the sex offender list is absolutely outrageous  but it's less likely than I thought.

CMV: Alcohol would never be made legal if it were new in society,"I think that we only accept alcohol in society because it is easy to produce and has existed for a long time. It seems almost certain that if it were a new drug  no rational arguments could support the introduction of alcoholic drinks.

As far as I can see the arguments against it would be: 

1. It will lead to unnecessarily dangerous driving resulting in deaths and the destruction of many lives

2. It will fuel aggressive and violent behaviour

3. Some people will become completely dependent on it and it will consume their lives and ultimately may give them a terminal illness

4. It will lead to unwanted pregnancies and other regrettable sexual encounters

The arguments for would go:

1. It will make socially awkward people feel more relaxed

2. It will lead to some interesting new drinks albeit almost all of these will be acquired tastes

"CMV: I believe that the oxford comma helps create a clearer meaning in text, and that it should be the standard for everyone to learn.","I just learned not to long ago that the Oxford comma  or when you apply a comma to the last word of a list. For example:

I am having a surprise party today: I need ice cream  balloons** ** and chairs. 

The oxford comma says that a comma should be where I bolded. However  I learned that some people are taught that they *don't* need to put a comma there  which would read as 

I am having a surprise party today: I need ice cream  balloons and chairs.



Why is this such a big deal? You can clearly understand what I am saying there. But what if the sentence made a tad less sense?


For example  I was eating a restaurant to too long ago and was looking at what flavor of wings they have. They had A  B  C....Y and Z. 

I was going to order two types  A and Y and Z. I assumed that Y and Z was a combination of two flavors. 


This is only but one anecdotal evidence for why I find the Oxford strictly better in almost every case. The only case where I believe it can be argued is in journalism where they can only use so many characters.

"CMV: Fighting a hundred duck-sized horses is clearly, unquestionably better than fighting a horse sized duck.","This is one of those questions where people act like it's some 50/50 thing  but to me  the answer is so obviously one sided. Ducks would be FUCKING TERRIFYING at horse size. Duck beaks are serrated and strong  and used for eating fish  snails  and crustaceans. That beak when it's a foot and a half long would be deadly. Plus  now you're facing a six foot tall behemoth that can attack by air or water. 

Now on the opposite end of the spectrum is a duck sized horse. There's literally nothing a horse that size could do to you other than annoy you. In real life  horses are only dangerous because of their sheer size and power  but with that taken away  they're totally harmless. It doesn't matter whether you have one or one hundred  horses don't have organized tactical skills and you can just mow them down. 

This question needs to be retired from ice breaking conversations. 


**Edit**: Please stop mentioning the square cube law and saying that the duck would crush itself under its own weight. I think /u/moonmixer put it quite well:

>This is the most pedantic and infuriating answer. It is obvious that we're already ignoring conventional physics and biology  because otherwise the question is completely pointless.
If the horse sized duck is biologically untenable under the premise of the question  then why the fuck ask the question?

"CMV: It's not ""creeping"", ""snooping"", or ""being a creeper"" to browse social media content that presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.","**Edit:** I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas  but as I won't have time to address everything  I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue  but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private * but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you  similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found  if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is  so I have posted some deltas. 

Thanks

I don't know if this is much of a phenomenon  but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. 

Suppose Susie makes a facebook page  and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities  some personal trivia  etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures  something she'd said at some point  etc. Susie reacts negatively to this  and calls Frankie a ""creep"" for ""looking through"" her profile. 

I'm 24  but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95  it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have ""good old days"".  And in the good old days  there was no such thing as ""creeping someone's profile"" online. Putting aside when a ""profile"" became a thing. We had web pages  with content we had written  that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing  you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information  or in some cases  all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes  and more. 

So the same thing happens now  except on Facebook or so  and the difference I can see is that  back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it  we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet  and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...

I feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective  but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way  or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin  and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives  and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words  you're a terrible creep  except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square  started posting text and images to it  and got mad when people came to look at them.

CMV: Hufflepuff is objectively the worst house and it is kind of an insult to be sorted into it.,"So my friend said they were sorted into Hufflepuff on Pottermore and my other friend said  ""yeah  I can see that."" It felt like an insult to me...like: ""you're not very smart but you're not particularly ambitious either to make up for it. And to top it off  you're not even brave. You're just kind of...there.""

When I double-checked the traits of Hufflepuff  it came up ""hard work  dedication  patience  loyalty  and fair play."" Fair play isn't even really a character trait  it's an ideal or a sense of morality. ""Hard work and dedication"" seem like a lesser version of Slytherin's ""ambition."" Loyalty is okay I guess but loyalty doesn't pay the bills or demand the same kind of respect as the traits of the other houses.

I feel like I may not be appreciating this house correctly and I mean no disrespect to any Hufflepuffs so please change my view.

Edit: Thanks so much for all of your responses! Sorry I couldn't respond to them all but you've all given me great points. I find myself actually wanting to be more like Hufflepuffs now.

CMV Diversity in movies shouldn't be a reason why the movie is good.,"<<<Spoilers for Force Awakens and kind of Moana>>>
This stems from recent calls for diversity in movies. I love diversity  everyone should be represented no matter what race/religion or sexuality  but when critics recommend films based on diversity. Or tumblr encourages people to go to movies because it is diverse  is wrong and encourages studios to make bad movies. 

A example of this is Moana  it was the first POC Disney ""princess"" in a long time  with Hawaiian culture and religion. This is good. Many people called it a good film. But many people said the movie was good because of the diversity  which isn't the case frankly. Any movie can be about culture or race but it needs to be done right. That's what should matter. Not just because POC are in the movie.

Another example is Rey from Star Wars. When I heard Rey was the main character  I thought it was sick that the focus was on a female Jedi. In The force Awakens  I had troubles liking her character. She was a Mary Sue  picked up a blaster and was an ace shot. Picked up lightsaber and could beat a sith apprentice who was trained by a supreme leader snoke and Luke Skywalker. This is diversity done poorly. Despite race gender religion or sexuality characters still should need character development. Hell she even got force mind tricks down on her first try.

CMV: It is obnoxious that I'm notified twice when receiving a message on Snapchat.,I don't need to be notified when someone is typing outside of Snapchat's User interface. It's annoying. The only time that I like to know when someone else is typing is when I'm actually using the app. When you're using the app  it totally makes sense to have a little animation  maybe even a subtle sound to indicate that the other party is typing  but once you're out of the UI  what's the point? I feel like when you're not in the UI  you're more disconnected from the conversation so there's no longer a reason to be notified when the other party is typing.

CMV: Reddit's new profile pages are a fundamentally bad idea and will not even do their intended purpose of attracting creators.,"As mentioned in the original r/announcements post [here](https://redd.it/60p3n1) Reddit is pondering the idea of adding user profile pages with the intention of making it work like a personal subreddit only the user is able to post on.

> Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users  content creators  and brands to post directly to their profile  rather than to a community. YouÕll be able to follow them and engage with them there. WeÕre excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit.

However  this will not appeal to content creators at all though. It might apply to brands  but most of them will probably not want *another* news feed to manage. Reddit is is *the* place for community. YouTubers and and other content creators alike would come here to be able to interact with their fans  not have another news feed. They want to see the fan art  and theories  and feedback. And not just in the comments. And why would they want to be the only moderator anyway. They have enough to deal with.

Everyone else is in this equation is just a fan anyways so why would *everyone* need a user page anyways. Those that make content make a subreddit. Those that don't don't.

See r/Pyrocynical  r/NeatMike  r/CGPGrey  and countless others.

----

Furthermore  As a web developer myself  I can feel how bad the dev team must want to update the site to the appy nature m.reddit.com is. There's a huge push right now in web dev to do mobile-first  no server-side rendering  and plenty more in order to reduce bandwith and make it easier and faster for mobile users. I get it  most people that view this very post are probably going to be on mobile  even in the US  and many developing markets are going to be mobile only.

Now don't get me wrong  I absolutely love the work that Google  Mozilla  and ^^yes ^^even ^^Webkit have been doing to make this easier and faster than ever before. But one thing I've noticed is that the mobile-first mindset is slowly starting to lean towards a desktop-last mindset in the process.

I love Reddit and want the best for this site in whatever that means  I just don't want you to lose yourself in the process <3

Change my view.

"CMV: People who see selfishness in every action we take (saying that if we ""feel good"" about what we did, then the deed loses its value, no matter how noble it was), hamper our efforts to become better","It's a kind of a sick trend: we start judging people's thoughts  emotions  motivation and imply that there is not true goodness  because there is no true selflessness. Well guess what? Everything counts! Your motivation  intentions and the results of your action. There is nothing wrong with feeling good when you do something good. I fail to understand why doing nothing could be any better. Should we feel terrible when we help someone? Would not gaining any emotional reward increase our noble deed's value?

"CMV:Learning how to do your taxes, budgeting and finance, emergency medical training, and leadership skills should be required to be taught in high schools.","I probably can solve algebraic equations  recite parts of the periodic table  and write a decent essay  but what I donÕt have are the skills to be successful after I graduate from college (If I am lucky enough to do so). I enjoy that high school taught me how to write well  and that skill will guide me all throughout my life. However  I think it is important for high schools to balance their curriculum with more practical skills than theoretical. I know some basic information on taxes through my government class  however  I have not a clue how to balance a checkbook or fill out an i-9 form. You may think I am ignorant: and I know I shouldnÕt spend more money than I have  but other than that I am seemingly unequipped to tackle the duties and hardships of financial life after University. My school also never taught me protocol if someone chokes  or if someone is having a heart attack. Obviously I wonÕt be in situations where someone is having a heart attack everyday  but I really think knowing how to save a human life is more important than solving a geometric proof.

"CMV: ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day"" is a myth perpetrated by advertising companies. So are ideas about the body's ability to cope with starvation.","First of all  although many studies exist that establish a correlation between better general health and eating breakfast  causation cannot be established.  This is actually a great example of correlation not necessarily implying causation.  The issue is that the demographic that is skipping breakfast is more likely to be poor or food insecure  and being poor or food insecure comes with an increased likelihood of poor nutrition and eating habits.  Furthermore  many of these studies are funded by organizations who have a conflict of interest.

And this is largely the issue with nutritional advice these days.  The problem  for these organizations  is that nutritional advice affects how people spend money on food  so they will want to do everything in their power to brainwash the general population into believing myths like the one in the title or that heaving fewer large meals is unhealthy and that one should eat smaller frequent meals.  And if people take on a variation of intermittent fasting  these companies will lose a lot of money because people will naturally buy less of everything grocery-related.

Another myth  ""starvation mode"" exists to discourage people from intermittent fasting for this reason.  It's not so much a myth  but rather an misunderstanding.  The phenomenon of starvation mode does exist  but only at dangerously low body fat percentages at which it has no choice but to burn energy from other organ systems.  This is an issue that many anorexic people deal with  which is partly why anorexia is so dangerous.  But the average person does not need to worry about starvation mode.  

Intermittent fasting or even just plain fasting (three to five days plus) will not in and of itself put the body in starvation mode  and [I]is[/I] an effective way to lose weight.  Losing weight is all ""calories in  calories out""  where calories in must be less than calories out.  Fasting and its variations accomplish that.  If one decides to only eat 4 days a week 2500 calories each  and his maintenance amount is 2000 per day  then after one week he will be at a deficit of 2000(7) - 2500(4) = 4000 calories per week.  

Another common misconception is how long the body can survive without food.  Many severely underestimate the body's ability to cope with famine and starvation.  The human body was designed to sustain itself for long periods without food.  The average person cannot eat for three weeks and still stay out of the hospital.  Some experiments have shown human capabilities of up to two months without food.  Also  fasting and its variants don't lower one's metabolism.  In fact  it increases it as a way of urging him or her to look for food.  In caveman times  one would often spend long period of time looking for food (possibly days at a time) before being successful.  Then he or she would feast and repeat the cycle.  If anything  the human body is better designed to follow a fast-feast cycle  suggesting that intermittent fasting may even be a more effective method of weight loss.  

It is unfortunate that advertising companies mislead the public by instilling such misconceptions about diet  eating habits  and weight loss for the purpose of maintaining high revenues  but that is to be expected.  It is unclear as to how this can be done  but the general public should learn that one does not need three meals a day and it is perfectly okay and possibly even beneficial to skip breakfast or any other meal.  And rather than insensitively referring to fasting methods for weight loss as ""anorexic""  it should be open-minded to how it works and understanding that the body is much better at going without food than they think and that not eating for sixteen or thirty-six hours isn't hard at all for the body like they think.

Personal side-note: I did alternate-day fasting for a few days and skipping breakfast almost every other day after that and even though I've been pretty liberal with my caloric restriction  have not been putting the weight that I lost.  I'm a 19-year-old male at 5'4 and I went from about 138 to 130 pounds in two weeks.  Did not experience any ""starvation mode"" symptoms nor do I feel unhealthy.  I also learned that the idea that one will simply gain weight back because they'll overeat after finally not eating was not true at all  at least to the extent that it would matter.  Besides  it's expected that on an alternate-day fasting schedule that one will eat reasonably above maintenance (about 500 calories more).

CMV: The end of a relationship or marriage does not mean it was unsuccessful or a failure.,"I think it is unfortunate that so many people view a romantic relationship as a ""failure"" or as ""unsuccessful"" simply because it comes to an end. For many  to break up is a shameful admission of defeat and puts a cloud of ""failure"" over the entire relationship. There's a stigma to breaking up and there should not be.

In reality  the majority of all romantic relationships end and 30-50% of marriages end in divorce (I'm not here to debate the specific statistic; can we just agree it's a significant number?). The end of relationships is something we should embrace as part of the human experience and we should not allow a relationship's impermanence to define its success or failure. Rather  we should allow what occurs during the relationship to determine its success or failure and will be much happier for it.

Personally  I've had several romantic relationships that I consider successes even though all but my current one has ended. I look back on the boyfriends and experiences we had with fondness and with appreciation  as they taught me a lot about myself  about what I want in life and a relationship  and about how to be a better boyfriend in the future. The endings were hard and painful  but necessary  and I'm friends with my exes to this day. 

Perhaps what partially informs this viewpoint is that I don't idealize romantic relationships as things that should last forever. I recognize that people are ever-changing/growing  and that what works for two (or three!) people at one point in their lives may not work in another.

This is not to say there are no relationships or marriages that are failures. Of course  if throughout an entire relationship someone is unhappy  abused  unfulfilled  etc.  I would consider it a failure. But if in a 1 year relationship you have 10 great months  or in a 30 year marriage you have 28 great years  the fact that it came to an end should not deem unsuccessful and people should not feel ashamed or that they have failed because of it.

CMV!

I believe holding bartenders legally liable for drunk drivers is bullshit. CMV,"Imagine this very common scenario: A man walks into a crowded bar  where the bartender can't possibly be expected to keep a careful eye on every single patron. He pays cash for his drinks all night  preventing the bartender from seeing a concise list of how drunk the guy might be. The entire time  as he's an experienced drunk  he's speaking clearly enough and walking cleanly enough that you believe him to be far less drunk than he is.

But he leaves the bar and drives home. He gets pulled over  or hits a tree  or any number of other terrible things  and it's discovered he's over the legal limit. All of a sudden  depending on the state (or even country ) the bartender may be sued in civil court or may face criminal charges for allowing the guy to leave and go drive drunk.

Now this is just one scenario  but the number of different scenarios that would prevent a bartender from accurately identifying someone who must be kept from driving *far outweigh* the number of scenarios where the bartender may stop the drunk without putting himself or others in danger.

You have to be a grown adult to purchase and consume alcohol in a bar  and you are thus responsible for your own actions. I believe that civilly or criminally holding someone else responsible for your poor decisions is utter bullshit  and the practice should be stopped.

"CMV: Despite the pretentiousness, Hipsters are the the most constructive, culturally-beneficial subculture in 40 years.","First  I'm definitely not a hipster. My youthful subculture was New Wave in the 80s  which was basically a blend of Emo and Goth (they're both better blended  IMHO). 

I'm in a coffee shop drinking a single-origin espresso and there are about a dozen young guys in the shop tasting house-roasted blends that are weighed (to the gram)  lovingly ground  and poured over with water at exactly 200 degrees. 

For some reason they're manscaped a bit like Charles Dickens if Dickens were a skater. I don't get the look  but the thing about youth is that guys like me aren't supposed to get the look. All subculture looks are contrived and a little silly...Punk  New Wave  Goth  Hippie  etc. Hipsters are too. So  really  it's not worth commenting on. That's just how it goes.

But on to the substance of the movement. Seeing kids hunker down and try to bring quality to their lives is nice. It's *really* nice  actually. Most youth subcultures just want to see the world burn. I did. We rebelled and made some amazing music but other than that we didn't accomplish a thing.

Hipsters though...they're really making the U.S. better (I can't speak for anywhere else). I have a butcher now...that's new. Somebody is bothering to source local meats and raise it with a minimum of cruelty. It's great. Vegetables are getting better also. At least they can be if you bother to look for the good ones. 

Coffee is WAY better thanks to their efforts. We now have an alternative to the pseudo-italian crap from Starbucks and they're trying to absorb coffee culturally and find an authentic expression for it. They're appropriating in the best sense of the word. Bad artists copy  great artists steal  as Picasso said. U.S. culture has been largely about copying  but these kids are starting to *steal*. There's nothing wrong with appropriating espresso  but they are trying to make it their own. 

They read. They care about quality and craft. Even Kerning is better than it has been (it's a design thing). They actually *care* about making things better.

Most of them were raised in the 90s  ~~which was the most unspeakably soulless decade in history (sorry kids...I know it was your childhood but it just sucked)~~ (Edit: I shouldn't have called it soulless...lots of good happened in the 90s). Every generation rebels  and we gave the Millennial generation something truly terrible to rebel against.

Even my *jeans* are better. Honestly. Some kid hemmed them for me the other day on some massive old machine in the shop. He did a hell of a job too...this shit is HEMMED. I haven't seen anything made to last in I don't even know how long. It's really  really nice to see.

So yeah  they're a little pretentious. An authentic identity take time to form  so young people will often wear a mask until they get it all sorted. For some reason these kids want to look like Victorian Circus Strongmen. Okay...it's different I guess. At least it's not bleak and driven by empty rebellion. That's gotten so boring.

I hope to see more of this trend. Please  start building houses. We need hipster housing. This whole ""slow"" thing...bring it on. They are not solely responsible for it  I realize  but they've popularized it  and championed it.

The criticisms people levy against them...they're pretentious posers  they try too hard  they just want to be different  etc. That's YOUTH. That's what happens when young people don't like the identity they're handed. It happens in every generation  so it's ridiculous to lay it squarely at their feet. 

If you look past that you can see how the millennial generation is doing good work--they're rebelling against the right things--and I for one am looking forward to more of their contributions.

Edit:

>I would argue that what you're praising is actually the Maker culture that started in the late 90s and early 21st Century.

So based on everything is seems the term ""Hipster"" is the main problem here. I was attributing ""Maker Culture"" to hipsters  and people objected to that. I still see ""Hipsters"" everywhere I see ""Maker Culture"" but I guess that's just my experience.


**Second Edit: Okay I need to get back to work. This has been very interesting. I've learned a lot about the negative effect this movement has had in urban areas  particularly in Brooklyn and San Francisco. Gentrification isn't cool. Income inequality is going to be a growing challenge for us  unfortunately. Sounds like these two cities are ground zero for what's to come a national epidemic.**

Third and final edit: Damn you people HATE hipsters  although there's no agreement on what the word means. I didn't realize that hipster was a term used almost exclusively in the negative. So really this was a pointless exercise. It's almost as if you define hipster as that group which looks funny and sucks. There's not much point in trying to have a conversation about a group of people who are  almost by definition  the embodiment of all that is crappy about youth culture.

"I believe that if singers don't write their own songs, they should be considered ""performers"" rather than ""musicians"" or ""artists."" CMV","True artists and musicians write and record their own music  based on what they **want** to record. Others that sing what someone else wrote should not be considered artists because their material is not created by them. (In the same vein  I wouldn't consider cover bands to be artists either.  But they are musicians  since they are playing instruments instead of building beats on a computer. But back to singers...). Their music is created by someone else *for* them  which they then record and take most of the credit for.  

Thus  singers are just *performing* a song  even if they don't ever do any live shows. They are performing the song in the studio when they record it. I get that some singers are truly talented  but I find it difficult to call them artists if someone else had the inspiration to write the material that they are simply converting to a format (music) that many people enjoy listening to. 

I've always been a little absentminded about radio music  since I mostly listen to progressive rock and metal  but when I discovered that many songs you hear on the radio aren't even written by the people that are performing them  I was astounded.

CMV: Adults can see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch,"Let me start off by first saying that my arguments here could apply to most cereals  candies  etc. that adults have been traditional thought to ""not get.""

There was time a decade or so ago where adults simply couldn't see that the swirls of cinnamon sugar are what makes it a delicious part of a balanced breakfast. I am not here to argue against that.  They would rack their brains to figure out what made it so delectable when the answer would be plain as day to us kids. 

But  here is the kicker  the adults of the past my still be adults  but the kids of the past are no longer kids. I'm 24 years old now  and as I typed the phrase ""us kids"" I felt a slight pain knowing it simply didn't apply to me anymore.  Like many of you who grew up with those cinnamon sugar bites  I now have a job  a car  I'm saving up for my own place. We have become adults.  Even if your mindset hasn't reached adulthood or you are uncomfortable with the label  many of you are still legally considered adults.

But  does that mean we don't know what makes Cinnamon Toast Crunch delicious? Of course not  we still and always will know that the cinnamon swirls are what makes it a taste you can see.

There is even some real evidence supporting my claim.  Cinnamon Toast Crunch ran their ""taste you can see"" [ad campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDtProCyMo) for 13 years from 1995 to 2008. Now  when would you expect a child to start watching TV and really digesting what they see in their programs and commercials? Well  since the [age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Jr.) recommendation for most early development TV is 2-6  we can assume 6 is the age where children can start to handle and digest real programming. 

So if 6 year olds started seeing these ads in 1995  what happened that made Post end the campaign in 2008? They realized the ads were invalid.  They raised an entire generation of kids for whom it was common knowledge what made Cinnamon Toast Crunch delicious (the cinnamon swirls). The youngest of the children the had indoctrinated were now 19 and were living proof that now it wasn't just kids who could see the truth.",149,2,2,5,5,"[['[drastically](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahukewi2uo_4zadlahuj-gmkhxnjdqkqfggdmaa&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.npr.org%2fsections%2fthesalt%2f2011%2f09%2f26%2f140753048%2fkids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological&usg=afqjcnerb3bbk0bvlaayhi9j_sjmqhm3ba&sig2=ti-dr69mhrrfjjer8n9dsa).'], ['crunch.](http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-cinnamon-toast-crunch-16074343.jpg)'], ['experience.](http://imgur.com/eiijwyr)'], ['[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdtprocymo)'], ['http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/26/140753048/kids-sugar-cravings-might-be-biological']]",0,41,1,No
CMV: Propaganda is rampant on Reddit and our collective approach needs re-evaluated.,"I'm going to use a certain subreddit related to Donald Trump as an example.

Since before the campaign political operators in Russia have been targeting this subreddit heavily. They chose Reddit because young people are more easily influenced by our nature. They chose Trump because he's a controversial and divisive figure. 

The target is new but the general goals of propaganda are as old as propaganda itself; Reducing the ability of a people to take unified political action through strategic misinformation. 

In response to this subreddit gaining popularity I believe the Reddit community as a whole reacted in a way that furthered the goals of these political operators against our interest.

Multiple anti-trump subreddits were created  people argued fervently against Trump in their subreddit  and regular posters in the Trump subreddit were ridiculed  ignored  or blocked from posting in other subreddits.

The effects of these actions isolated legitimate users ( Actual Americans who support Trump and believe he and his politics will do the most good for America ). This isolation increased the ability of political operators to spread their misinformation without fact checking or thoughtful dissenting arguments.

I think that's the key  fact checking and thoughtful dissenting arguments. This is the only approach that will ever work against propaganda. It's human nature to reject a difference in opinion when the ""opponent"" isn't treating you respect. 

For that reason I think the optimum reaction from our community should have been going into their subreddit and having real discussions with people about ideas in a civil manner.

There are legitimate users there who are human and care about their country. Even if your counter opinion isn't well received or is ridiculed by 10 possible shills  some real person will still read and think about it. And it's for that person that the effort is worth it.",227,1,2,14,19,"[['[neutralpolitics](http://redditmetrics.com/r/neutralpolitics)', '[neutranews](http://redditmetrics.com/r/neutralnews)', 'stats](http://redditmetrics.com/r/changemyview)'], ['propaganda](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/american-propaganda-world-war-ii.html).', 'independence](http://study.com/academy/lesson/american-revolution-propaganda-examples-posters.html).', 'revere](http://www.businessinsider.com/pro-independence-propaganda-from-the-american-revolution-2015-7/#is-parchment-was-used-to-call-american-patriots-to-arms-as-the-war-heated-up-1)'], ['https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/world/2017/10/2/16396612/las-vegas-mass-shooting-terrorism-islam'], ['https://www.psychotactics.com/why-too-many-ideas-in-an-article-make-you-feel-nauseous/'], ['http://gawker.com/wikileaks-reveals-reddit-co-founder-tried-to-work-for-s-1202234100'], ['racist](http://statenews.com/article/2017/11/letter-its-not-okay-to-be-white)'], ['facilities](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/14/activist_group_restore_the_fourth_utah_adopts_highway_to_nsa_data_center.html).'], ['https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/world/2017/10/2/16396612/las-vegas-mass-shooting-terrorism-islam'], ['classification](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/att-and-comcast-win-lawsuit-they-filed-to-stall-google-fiber-in-nashville/).'], ['http://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['naive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hash_table).', 'possible](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotdep08/tech/full_papers/haeberlen/haeberlen_html/index.html)'], ['http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4810130/']]",0,54,0,No

what I have done here is use the English language to convey my emotions and important information in the smallest amount of time.

CMV: The current implementation of Micro-transactions with Loot Boxes is fundamentally hurting the Gaming Industry's future prospects.,"In the last few years we have seen a massive rise in Micro-transactions in games through the form of Lootboxes  paid Mods  and in-store shops for real money. From Overwatch to Shadow of War  the new normal in many Triple A titles is the limited access to loot boxes which can be alleviated by paying real world money. 

Recalling in the previous decades the huge moral backlash Games got due to games like GTA. Concerned parents and eager politicians raised significant concerns for gamers about the continuation of their favorite hobby. The ESRB rating system came into effect due to the brutal violence of Mortal Kombat and similar games  and the concerns of what damage it could do to our children. In due time  however  it became obvious from a sea of studies that there was no causal connection between violence in video games and actual violence  and the concern slowly abated.  

However  there are now ample studies that the Loot Boxes seen in games such as CS:GO  TF2  Overwatch  Shadow of War  a vast majority of Phone games  etc. are [genuinely triggering](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/10/12/the-esrb-is-wrong-about-loot-boxes-and-gambling/#18a96f4e2a64) the same sectors of the brain as gambling does. This  unlike the panicked response to virtual violence in the past  has real consequences for those who succumb to the allure.

We've all heard stories of people spending thousands of dollars or wasting their parent's money on loot boxes  and it's becoming more and more commonplace. My major concern is twofold:


1: Due to the lucrative nature of this business model  and lower need of staff to maintain it (See The Old Republic as an example) it will shrink the overall size of the industry as they can afford to lay off staff to maintain the same level of profit.

2: Eventually some politician is going to realize there is an undeniable connection between Loot Boxes and Children Gambling  and it is a very real concern for the health of the industry if they issue sweeping legislation to 'Stop it' that could effect us as a whole.

Those who use lootboxes as the primary source of income are certainly making a profit  but tethering the future of Triple A gaming to it is a major risk for us as a whole.

EA has made it clear in recent publications in it's belief in multiplayer being the primary drive of future content. If tomorrow a law is passed banning any form of lootbox  it's not as if they can turn around and remove them all tomorrow. Their entire business model for the next few *years* at a minimum will be built around exploiting this market. How many studios find themselves equally invested  and hold that same risk?

"CMV: Political Correctness has not only gotten way out of hand, but it is, ultimately, detrimental to a healthy society.","First  let me clarify by saying I don't support actual  intentional bashing of any kind  however:

We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude  distasteful  ignorant  what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity  it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution. 

It is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions. 

This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word ""cisgendered"" and wether it is ""normal"" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure  if you are asking what gender someone is  it is okay  even good  to distinguish  but all I keep seeing around here  and in real life  and at an increasing rate  is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems  men can't relate to women's suffrage  cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through.. it just keeps getting more and more specific  and in my opinion  its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world  and doesn't actually help us make it better.

Adversity is everywhere  it hits everyone.  I may be a man  but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white  but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood  but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is  none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change  doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again  I'm not saying bullying is okay  but the line between what is considered okay to joke about  and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes  trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth.

TL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering  everyone has a hard life  and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better.

I hope you don't think i'm terrible for thinking this way  and I would love to hear everyone's input.

I believe that the NFL is a for profit organization and should not be tax exempt. CMV.,"I understand that the teams are for profit and therefore pay taxes  however the NFL organization is considered by the IRS a 501(c)6 (with specific tax and antitrust exemptions for the NFL passed into law in 1966).

The IRS defines a 501(c)6 organization as (emphasis added):

>A business league is an association of persons having some common business interest  the purpose of which is to promote such common interest and **not to engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit.** Trade associations and professional associations are business leagues. To be exempt  a business leagueÕs activities must be devoted to improving business conditions of one or more lines of business as distinguished from performing particular services for individual persons. No part of a business leagueÕs net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual and **it may not be organized for profit to engage in an activity ordinarily carried on for profit (even if the business is operated on a cooperative basis or produces only enough income to be self-sustaining).**  The term line of business generally refers either to an entire industry or to all components of an industry within a geographic area.  It does not include a group composed of businesses that market a particular brand within an industry.

I have significant trouble believing that an organization which spends roughly $10 million annually on one man (the Commissioner) does not engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit (regardless of its success in doing so).  With the knowledge that my argument effectively boils down to  ""They have a massive revenue stream.  Tax them!"" the NFL already enjoys exemption from antitrust laws.  It and any other professional sporting league with an enormous monetary stream (MLB surrendered its tax exempt status in 2007) should not also be allowed to operate without paying taxes.  Change my view.

Edit: Grammar & spelling

Edit 2: When using the terms the League or NFL it should be understood that I am making reference to the organization which governs the member teams of the National Football League and not the member teams themselves unless otherwise state.",252,1,3,24,29,"[['[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pass-through_taxation)'], ['needle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_needle_v._nfl).', '[cite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_baseball_club_v._national_league)'], ['states.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonprofit_organization)'], ['http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-maher/new-rule-football-sociali_b_815673.html'], ['http://sportsfans.org/2012/03/why-is-the-national-football-league-given-tax-exempt-status/'], ['3](http://www.charitynavigator.org/__asset__/studies/2012_ceo_compensation_study_final.pdf)'], ['http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/198326#ixzz2ehyivahj'], ['[about.com', 'salaries](http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_charities_salaries.htm)', 'foundation](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/10/18869742-susan-komen-ceos-salary-draws-fire-as-donations-drop-races-are-canceled?lite)', 'aarp](http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/aarp_report_final_pdf_3_29_11.pdf)'], ['move](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/03/14/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-nfl-antitrust-lawsuit/)'], ['[relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prexdn0fbzo)'], ['it.](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopick03.pdf)', '¤6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501\\(c\\)_organization#501.28c.29.286.29)'], ['source:http://www.econlib.org/library/smith/smwn12.html'], ['plating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gold_plating_\\(software_engineering\\))'], ['http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_bay_packers#public_company'], ['organizations*](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopick03.pdf),'], ['http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/89/hr17607/text'], ['amazon.com,'], ['http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong.html'], ['http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_football_league'], ['http://www.forbes.com/nfl-valuations/'], ['http://www.pellegrinoandassociates.com/top-five-revenue-sources-that-drive-value-for-the-nfl/'], ['http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1605281'], ['http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2013/8/8/amazons-profits'], ['now](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/12/emails-ois-lerner-specifically-targeted-tea-party/)).']]",0,70,1,No
CMV: Getting fountain drinks without ice is better than drinks with ice.,"I firmly believe that ice ruins any fountain drink other than water. There are a couple of reasons for this;

1. If you get a drink with ice and don't drink it all in one sitting (or get a refill to take home) the ice will melt and water down the beverage  making the taste usually significantly worse. 

2. Adding ice to the drink significantly affects the possible volume of the drink. Even if you don't specifically want more to drink  you're still paying the same amount for far less drink when you put ice in the cup. 

Now  the only pro I can see to putting ice in your cup is to make the drink colder. Which while that can be nice  it does take a little while to take affect and very few fountain drinks are drastically improved being cold. 
 
Edit: I've posted about controversial political issues several times before on this sub  yet I've never experienced name calling and insults here.

CMV: Burritos are better than tacos.,"All the food at taco bell are just the same 4 ingredients presented in a different way. Tacos are impractical. If you drop a taco  you've lost out on your meal  unless you're willing to scoop up all the ingredients that have splattered everywhere  and reassemble the taco shell. If you drop a burrito  if it splits open  most of the ingredients are going to be left inside the tortilla. 

There is only one real way to correctly eat a taco. If you try to eat it from top down  you're going to get a good mouthful of salty  dry tortilla  and all the contents of the taco are going to be untouched. You can eat a burrito any way you want. You can throw the burrito in the air and catch it in your mouth. If you try that with a taco  the contents are going to fly everywhere.

The burrito is better than the taco in all ways.

CMV: Penne is the worst pasta noodle.,"I feel that penne is the worst pasta noodle for the following reasons:

- Penne has a terrible texture.  It is too chewy and even a little chalky compared to other pasta noodles.  

- Penne takes too long to cook  especially as compared with extremely delicious noodles such as capellini (angel hair).  Furthermore  because each penne noodle constitutes a significant portion of your noodle supply  tasting even a few penne noodles during cooking can meaningfully reduce the amount of available noodles after they are ready.     

- Penne's tubular shape makes it difficult to stab the noddles with a fork  and keep in place.  Also  when you stab it  sauce is likely to squirt out and ruin your shirt.  

- Because of their unwieldy shape and size  it is almost impossible to tailor the amount of noodle to other ingredients in each bite you take from a penne dish.

- The most popular penne dish  penne arrabbiata  as traditionally prepared  lacks an adequate protein component  making it a contributing cause of unhealthy diet practices  which can lead to obesity  heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

- The word penne is Italian for ""quill.""  In glamorizing antiquated writing tools  penne subliminally encourages our culture to reject modern technology  such as electricity and vaccines  which have enriched and saved countless lives.

- Penne's hollow nature teaches children that it is fine to neglect their inner selves  while focusing only on the superficial exterior.  This has lead to increasing narcissism in our society.

- Penne's long cylindrical shape represents the male phallus and is therefore a symbol of the oppression of women  the patriarchy and rape culture.

CMV: Hard-shell tacos don't make any sense,"Here are the problems I have with crunchy tacos:

* I have to turn my head sideways in order to take a bite without spilling the ingredients.

* It inevitably falls apart  meaning I have to have a plate ready to catch the filling  and then I have to either use a fork or pick up the loose ingredients with my fingers.

Am I missing something? Is there some trick to eating them? Do crunchy tacos have some appeal that overcomes these shortcomings?

If given the ingredients to make a hard-shell taco  I can't think of any reason not to break up the shell and make a salad instead.

Whether it's to work  to meet a friend  or for a date. People who show up on time to work  but then late to plans with their friends are assholes. I understand that everybody has stuff going on in their lives that makes it impossible to show up on time every time  but if it's happening like 3  or 4 times  then that's just a person being disrespectful and not giving a fuck about the people they're making wait on them. In my personal life  I'm even more strict  because I really despise these individuals. After the second time a friend is late to our plans  I will no longer invite that person to hang out.

"I think dropping $25,000+ on a wedding makes no sense when that money could be diverted into buying a house together and start off married life on the right foot. CMV","I understand that your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life  so I can understand the need to spend big and lavish. However  money is tight for a lot of people nowadays and the average American wedding costs almost 30 large [source](http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-planning/wedding-budget/qa/what-does-the-average-wedding-cost.aspx). It makes more sense to me to get a tiny ceremony and use that money to buy a house instead  at least that way its a better investment of that 30 grand and also starts off your married life on a better foot than coming back from your honeymoon empty handed. CMV

Edit: I also realize that 30 thousand is not enough to outright buy a house  but it still constitute a solid down payment. And of course  if I had the money to get both my house AND my dream wedding  I would obviously do it. However  most people in this country cannot afford both in their 20's  myself included  and if I was given the choice between a huge wedding vs getting a house with my SO  I would take the house  since I would value a decent financial start of my new life with my SO over a huge lavish wedding where everyone and their dog is invited. With the house payment  I would still get a small  intimate ceremony and a tiny reception with our closest friends and family. At least with this approach  I still get to celebrate this huge milestone with the people I care about most  AND have a house to live in and start our lives with.

CMV: Apple are falsely equating simplicity with minimalism in their hardware design,"**Update**

Thanks for all the replies  there's been some really useful points and I'll dish out the deltas appropriately. The most convincing argument I've heard is that Apple is trying to build a computer for the near future and if it doesn't work for you then you don't have to buy it. USB-C is the future so why bother putting anything else in? USB lets you charge from a battery charger which is an extra convenience  even if it comes at the loss of MagSafe so why have a dedicated power socket? Most people take pictures with their phone and the latest camera models are coming with wireless support so SD support won't be important.

I do think they've made a mistake with how they're handling headphones across devices but I have been convinced that their logic for this is an attempt to move to the future of wireless headphones  not stripping things away for the sake of it. While I think wireless headphones can be great  I'm still not convinced that they're going to replace wired headphones but that's a separate debate.

Another good point was made that Apple has shifted from being for power users and creatives to a more mainstream consumer level product (albeit still at a high price point). This helps understand that some of their changes will alienate some of their long-term customers and remove what some consider vital functionality. Again I'm not 100% convinced by how well that will play out as power users are broadly the demographic most willing to embrace new technology (and the expense that comes with it) but I'm happy to be proven wrong.

So all-in-all  I've been convinced that minimalism isn't the driving force of Apple's hardware designs  it's an attempt to shape the direction^1 of the the market and speed up the process.



^1 Mixed metaphor?

-------------------------

There's a massive anti-Apple circlejerk going on right now so I'm looking for people to actually stick their neck out and defend Apple.

Apple have been very proud of their history of cutting out the unnecessary and providing a better experience for the user. This has lead to hugely successful products such as the iPod and the iPhone that took existing markets and offered a revolutionary and innovative solution. They achieved this in small ways too e.g. MagSafe. However  I think they've made the wrong conclusions from their success and now believe that to be innovative  they have to reduce.

Simplicity  in the context of the technology industry  is about making things easy to use. MagSafe  to use a previous example  illustrates this well:

* It worked both ways up and the magnet helped attach the cable for you - almost no thought is needed to plug the computer in.

* The magnet was strong enough that it wouldn't detach if you moved your laptop a bit but would effortlessly detach when pulled at an angle.

* The built in colour LED told you if it was charging or fully charged. 

Minimalism strives to have as little as possible  whatever the cost. To continue the MagSafe example  if you can draw enough power through a USB port then you can get away with having one less port on the computer. However you're now missing all the advantages from above of having dedicated port  especially:

* It's harder to plug in

* It doesn't easily detach when pulled

I would argue that removing this port is to assume that minimalising the design (only having USB ports) makes it simpler to use which I don't believe to be the case.

I think this is also true of lots of their design decisions from the last few years:

**Latest MacBook Pro**

* No USB-A port when used by almost all peripheral hardware
* No SD card when still widely used by amateur and professional photographers/videographers

**iPhone 7**

* Removed headphone jack while bluetooth headphones aren't objectively better than wired headphones and are generally much more expensive.
* Cable supplied doesn't work with new MacBook Pro
* Headphones supplied don't work with new MacBook Pro
* No wired headphones can work with the new MacBook Pro and the iPhone 7 without an adaptor
* Still persisting with Lightning when USB-C has become industry standard

**Latest Mac Pro**
(the round black one  not the tower)

* Only single drive inside  other drives have to be peripheral
* USB and Headphone ports on back of device

**iMac**

* USB and Headphone ports on back of device

In conclusion  Apple were once heralded for making products that 'just worked' but this is no longer true as their design ethos has moved from simplicity to minimalism  at the expense of the user experience.

My title assumes that Apple are unaware that they're making this mistake but I'm willing to concede that they may be aware of this shift (although if they are then I would like to hear the business argument).

To change my view you need to make the case for how the changes above improve the usability and user experience of Apple's products.

I'm not arguing that this trend has reached every aspect of their product range so examples of Apple doing things well won't be enough to change my view  unless you can show that my examples represent the minority of hardware changes.

CMV: It is selfish to confess romantic feelings to someone who is potentially or certainly unable to reciprocate. It only makes yourself feel better while placing an unnecessary burden on them to be responsible for your feelings.,"As stated I do not see a purpose to confessing unrequited love. It may potentially make you feel better to get it off your chest but it will not produce any positive gain to your target or your relationship with them. Consider for example the following scenario:

Person A has a crush on Person B. Person B is gay. Person A is straight.

Person A confesses that they have romantic feelings towards person B that they know person B is incapable of reciprocating.

Person A feels better  like they got a big secret burden off of their chest.

Person B is now questioning every innocuous facet of their relationship and whether isolated incidents had more than surface level meaning to them. 

""There was that one time they called me cute  I took it platonically but maybe they meant more by it?""

""I dont know if I can be comfortable with platonic physical affection anymore knowing it is not platonic for them.""

""The relationship feels awkward for me now  I don't know how to act around them anymore"".

""Have I led them on somehow?""

""Should I be alone with them anymore?""

Person B may experience everything from undeserved guilt to frustration  anger  or doubt. These feelings would be exacerbated if person A and person B had a particularly close friendship.

What did person A get out of it?

Person A could have had multiple different motivations  potentially concurrent.

""Maybe just maybe they'll feel the same"".

The problem with this reasoning is that you shouldn't  go from 0 to 60 without putting the car through a few gears first. If you have a romantic interest in someone and believe there is the possibility they could reciprocate  you ask them out. Confessing feelings for someone you've never so much as been on a bona fide date with yet is the wrong approach to romance in general. If you ask them out and they decline  there is no real loss to the relationship as long as you take the rejection gracefully. However if you confess feelings and they do not reciprocate you will put strain on the relationship.

By confessing feelings you are increasing the burden placed on them to either reject or accept your advances  and it is a selfish and overwhelming approach.

""I know they cant reciprocate but it's killing me feeling this way and having to hide it. It would make me feel better to out all of the cards on the table.""

You are making yourself feel better. You're doing no favors for your target. The emotional burden of your feelings is yours and yours alone and by confessing them as if you were confessing a sin you are trying to force your friend to help you carry the burden. 

""They have a right to know.""

They probably don't want to know. They aren't lying awake at night wondering if you secretly harbor feelings for them. They probably haven't given it much thought. Yesterday they did not have this problem on their plate and today they do.

In summation I really strongly disagree with common advice doled out on relationship subreddits dealing with unrequited love. I do not believe a confession of those feelings is the right approach. Rather I believe the feelings should be dealt with like any other inappropriate feelings you should not act on  with the extreme end being to address the feelings in therapy if they are problematic enough

CMV: Reddit has seen its golden age and has been in its decline for a while now; we need a new site.,"So it's pretty clear that the mods and admins have been shady for about two-ish years when the whole ViolentAcrez thing happened and Reddit hit CNN in a negative light so they threw him under the bus.  I'm going to call that the start of it all because between Project Panda (/r/shitredditsays 's community wide project to get that handful of subreddits banned by any means necessary.) and Reddit going from giving ViolentAcrez Reddit awards to just leaving him out in the cold  that's what caught my eye.  I could be wrong.

/r/BronyHate got banned before /r/niggers which was always weird to me... and I never really saw justification for it.

GamerGate hit Reddit pretty hard and they went full lockdown on a bunch of the main subs with all that drama and the undeniable full-on censorship of anything regarding that topic. 

And now with videos sprouting up about the double standard between ""self promotion"" posts getting removed for some users  while other (more famous) users are obviously there to promote a movie or book or whatever else having no problem.

...and then there's [this whole thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/2kdg2n/333501261_til_male_victims_of_domestic_violence/) happening yesterday.  I think what bothers me most about this is that in a sub of about 7 million subscribers (that's  what  a [third of the Reddit community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/about/traffic) ) 

Now a lot of people would say ""Well it's the SJW invasion blah blah blah"" and while SJW's are a fun group of crazy people I'm particularly fond of bickering with (full disclosure) I think it's a bit different than that  but not too far off.

When Reddit got bought by Advance Publications in 2011  the shift towards *marketing* Reddit began.  

Before 2011  it was basically a free for all.  Not much was censored and posts stood on their merit  rather than if they passed arbitrary rules made up by people appointed as 'the boss of everyone else' simply because they got there first.  It's one of the shittiest ways to decide who's in charge.

And it's not necessarily the content changing direction that I have a problem with  it's that mods and admins have forced it in that direction.

The community is lost to an oligarchy of people who couldn't care less about what everyone wants  so long as the site still generates traffic.

This is what happened to Digg  and there isn't really anything anyone can do about it.

Personally I'm just curious as to who will successfully start the next Reddit.  You don't really need much more of a draw than a better way to regulate content than artificially influenced voting and arbitrarily set rules made by nearly random people.

tl;dr - Reddit is sliding into ruin and it's all mods' /  admins' fault.

CMV: Hamburgers should be eaten upside down for an optimal experience,"I believe eating a hamburger is best done with the entire burger upside down  meaning that the top bun is on the bottom and the bottom bun is on the top and any toppings/sauces are underneath the patty. Basically one would make a normal burger and turn the entire thing upside down. 

I have 2 main reasons as to why this is the superior way to consume a hamburger

1. Hamburger buns have thicker tops than bottoms. This means that any juices from the burger will be absorbed into the top when it is underneath the party. This is far better than the inferior soggy-bottomed burgers most people are used to. 

2.  As one bites down on a hamburger their tongue touches the burger from the bottom  meaning that toppings are easier to taste when a hamburger is upside down. The tongue will come into contact with the toppings just before the patty  which is the ideal circumstance.

"CMV: My TA wore a ""Friends Don't Let Friends Vote Republican"" t-shirt to class today. This is unprofessional behavior.","I am an undergraduate student and today I walked into my class that the teaching assistant was leading to find that he was wearing a t-shirt with the words ""Friends Don't Let Friends Vote Republican"" written on it  along with a picture of an elephant with a dunce cap. Now  I don't consider myself to be a Republican (though I do sometimes vote Republican  depending on who's running)  so this didn't bother me too much personally  but it did strike me as unprofessional and inappropriate for a TA to be wearing. 

I know that college campuses are relatively laid-back work environments  especially for students with teaching jobs (as most TAs are)  but I do think that wearing explicitly political t-shirts  and more specifically ones that put down those with other political views  is inappropriate  even in this context. I think this is particularly true when the person in question is in a position of authority over others  like a TA and his students. 

Edit: To clarify my viewpoint  I do not think that the TA shouldn't be allowed to wear this t-shirt  or that he should be fired  or suffer any other negative consequences. I merely think that his choice to wear it was unprofessional and inappropriate given the context. I am not ""offended"" or ""upset"" by the fact that he wore the t-shirt  I merely think it was an unprofessional decision  but am open to having my view changed  which is why I posted in this sub.

I believe that the Oxford comma adds clarity and consistency  since all the other list elements are separated by commas.  For those of you who prefer to skip it: why?

CMV: Sapiosexual is a ridiculous and useless term,"
Some niche sexuality labels I can understand. ""Asexual"" is debatable if it counts as an orientation  but I can understand pragmatically the use of such a label since not feeling sexual attraction would be pretty important to understanding a persons sexuality.

""Polyamourous"" is an ugly as hell word  but again I can see its usage in a pragmatic sense.

As far as sapiosexual goes though  well  ""Smart"" isnt a gender  so its not a sexuality. But I'm not sure it even counts as a fetish either  to say that you prefer ""smart"" people implies that  what  everyone else on the planet doesn't?

That seems to be the implication at least  which gives it an extremely self-congratulatory air: ""I am a SMART person who likes SMART things and I only sleep with other SMART people""

(Somewhat tangentially  people who self identify as ""smart"" in general tend to arouse my suspicion in any case.)

I dont see what gives it any more merit than say  having a sexual preference for women with large breasts and declaring yourself ""abigboobasexual"".

"CMV:While I Can't deny that Ellen Pao is a terrible CEO, the way Reddit has been treating her is not okay","I was just at the apology post and pretty much every comment is at best ""apology unaccepted."" and at worst and more commonly ""die you devil bitch!"". What the hell happened to common decency? It's not like she started World War III  or committed genocide or held hostages at gunpoint. You want to know what she did she ran a website we always waste our time on poorly. Since when is that a crime against humanity? Oh wait it isn't. I'm not saying we have to like her but I'm saying this is not OK to call her devil or C**t  or wish bad things upon her or the worst has her face being posted on pornographic images that's not OK that's bullying and completely inappropriate. Would you want to be treated this way if you screwed up like her? So go change my view why does Ellen Pao Deserve all this?


Edit: I never said I didn't dislike her I do I just think Redditors are being as immature as preschoolers when expressing their hatred of her.

Edit 2: RIP my inbox. Never thought that would happen.

CMV: I think that TED talks suck.,"I've been watching a couple of TED talks today and in the past I have maybe seen 20 or so of them. I have to be honest  they all sucked. Most of them could be described as ""oversensationalizing the mundane"" where the only amazing thing about the talk is the fact that the people in the audience appears completely captivated. Many TED talks  especially the most often lamented ones on social media  describe incredibly obvious things. There is one that I've realized is probably the most seen TED talk on their channel which is about creativity not being taught in schools and that some kid that struggled with math suddenly became a great dancer. Great. Or something.

Edit: I guess the reason why I think they suck is because there is in essence never any substance that cannot be boiled down to one single sentence. The only exception I can think of is the talk by Bill Gates about climate change. I feel like there is so much energy put into making what they are talking about into something that sounds like it will change the world when in fact it's the most obvious and mundane thing ever. They all have this cadence as if they are trying to rouse amazement that becomes so cringeworthy after the 20th TED talk.

Perhaps I'm just a grump and perhaps I just don't get it but for now I have to say I really don't like TED talks. Please CMV!

"CMV: Reddit is still an echo-chamber, especially in the political realm.","It's been my opinion for quite some time that Reddit is more or less a ""follow what we saw  or lose your opinion"" sort of site. The things that appease the general view-point of the majority of Reddit is repeated and stressed moreso over the views of the smaller  minority of Reddit. 

The most recent of course comes from Trump. I am neither for or against Trump  but the severe toxicity that Reddit expresses towards anyone who claims to have voted for Trump  or shows anything *but* anger towards Trump supporters is belittled and basically cast out  thus further strengthening the weird echo-chamber mentality that Reddit has going on. 

Overall  it seems that Reddit has an issue being able to see many issues  including political ones  from other sides of an issue  therefore the only ones that are seen are the ones that are in tune with the overall mindset of the average Redditor  and once again keeping the echo-chamber alive  unless someone is able to convince me otherwise.

CMV:We live in a society where we are too easily offended.,"While I understand why a team name like ""Redskins"" is a bigoted name  I don't understand why people get offended over something so inconsequential. If Notre Dame changed it's name to the ""Drunken Fighting Irish""  I wouldn't be personally offended  I would just think the people who ran the organization were morons.  

We live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage  or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.  If someone says something bigoted  ignorant  or stupid  it shouldn't personally offend you.  It is rumored that George H.W. Bush said that atheists can't be patriots.  I don't find a comment like that offensive  I just think he's ignorant for saying it.  

I understand finding racial profiling or stop and frisk offensive  policies that actually impact your life that are sanctioned by the state.  I don't understand being offended by one person's opinion.

CMV: /r/NoFap is bullshit,"So I did NoFap half a year ago and lasted for about 4 months. I felt really good and felt like I had more confidence  self-love and etc...

I think that quitting porn is good  but not masturbation.
I did NoFap and I almost lost my libido for 4 months (I did NoFap months before and it's the same with the libido thing) and it felt pretty strange. I know that there is what is called ""flatline"" but it was pretty unusual. 4 months is a huge time compared to other people  and to think that I didn't PMO a lot before I started NoFap (once or twice a day). The libido did rise a week or two before I stopped doing NoFap but it was still pretty low. I have also read things that other people have wrote on the internet that they lost their libido completly (after doing NoFap for months  a year etc).

I also have seen all those dumb articles and blogs about semen retention. Godammit.

After I stopped doing NoFap I felt like shit  I was tired  unmotivated and weak. After some time everything came back to normal. I understand now that you feel like you set your mind to. I did NoFap and said that masturbation makes you tired  weak etc. This is what my mind always thougth  it got used to me doing NoFap so what I felt after ejaculating was pretty strong  now I don't feel any of those.

The study that says that testosterone levels rise after not ejaculating for 7 days? I have heard that they drop even lower after that.

A part of the community was weird. ""Night-vision improved""  ""A girl looked at me"" etc...
Another thing that bothers me about NoFap is sex. If you ejaculate you lose all your superpowers  right? But sex is the same thing  what's the fucking point?

And premature ejaculation  wet dreams and blue balls  what the fuck?

CMV: Marriage proposals are done for attention and theatrics,"I'm going to be honest. I grew up on the dream that one day my future husband would drop on his knees with a diamond ring and ""pop the question"" to me. I  of course  would scream in joy  ""yes!"" That scene would mark our engagement.

I talked to my dad about how he ""proposed"" to my mom  where did he do it  did he hide the ring beforehand  etc.. (Both aren't from the U.S  although I was raised here). My dad had no idea what I was talking about. In the specific area where they are from  the western proposal doesn't exist.  Getting engaged is a conversation. Man and woman sit down and have a conversation about getting married and together decide to marry.  

He found it worrisome that a couple would decide spontaneously to marry instead of having a serious conversation about it and making an informed decision together  considering how life altering the decision to marry his. And he didn't get the point of the on your knees proposal with an expensive ring when you can just have a conversation about it. 

I slowly got where my dad was coming from.  A couple of years ago  I was in a relationship with a man who I wanted to marry. We both knew we wanted to marry each other and had talked about it for years. It was really just a matter of time for us to have a final conversation about whether we were both ready and formally become engaged  the way my parents did it.  Given that we had already talked about it many times and had decided we wanted to marry one another  it would have been a bit weird and redundant for him to get down on his knees and ask me a question he already knows the answer to.   (Unfortunately  I moved back the US so it didn't work out between him and me). 

I think most couples follow my model in that marriage is discussed previously throughout the relationship.  But rather instead of having a final conversation to finalize when to officially become engaged and to start wedding planning  they do ""proposals"" where the man gets on his knees with an expensive ring and the woman pretends to be shocked.  I think it's theatrics and just done for attention. 

Diamond ring companies  advertised this get down on your knees with a ring thing in the US  Europe  Canada and Australia. People want to recreate the scene they see on t.v. into their proposal stories for others to see or to tell others about. It's a redundant theatric  done for attention. Even the ones who don't do it in front of people   later show their rings on social media or tell the theatric tale to friends. 

It's also done as self-validation about their relationships.  It's about the woman wanting to feel wanted. It's about her wanting to know that this man has chosen her out of all the others and has made this big  grand gesture as proof.   For the man to remind himself that he chosen this woman out of all the others and using the big  grand gesture as proof of their love  as a way to validate their relationship to himself.  

**EDIT : People have been confused about what I am saying/arguing.  TL/DR below.** 

First  when I say marriage proposals are theatrics.

Most couples in modern times have already talked about marrying in previous conversations and have already expressed their intent to marry  although it is not crystallized or official. But rather than simply having a final conversation about it and using a simple final conversation to crystalize their engagement  they go over the top and use proposal theatrics. The man has to buy a ring (most of the time)  get on his knees and ask the woman and sometimes even do it in public.

The ""on your knees with a ring"" proposal isn't necessary at all. He damn well knows the answer to the question  they've spoken about it before.  It's re-creating a theater scene.  They are doing it for the theatrics of it and for self-validation. Validation the woman demands the man use to ""prove"" his love to her and for the man to validate his relationship.

Second  when I say marriage proposals are done for attention: I'm distinguishing between public proposals and privately done proposals.

I think public proposals are definitely done for attention. I think someone compared it to somebody asking someone to go to prom through a public announcement.

I think some private proposals are also be done for attention to  so they can post it on social media or tell their friends. Especially some women want to have a story of ""how he proposed"" to tell their friends.

CMV: Keeping Clifford the Big Red Dog as a private pet is deeply irresponsible and unsafe,"Emily Elizabeth Howard is a young American girl who owns Clifford- who is a big red dog. But not just a little bit big. Really big. Clifford is [shown to be larger than a 2-story house](http://i.imgur.com/kI0acIL.jpg)  making him probably about 30 feet tall. For comparison  the male African Bush Elephant  the largest land animal  maxes out at about 11 feet tall. A male giraffe can reach nearly to 20 feet  but is a very narrow and slight creature. So looking at his height and supposed weight  Clifford has all of the bulk and power of the elephant with the height exceeding that of giraffes  making him easily the largest land animal in the world  by a far sight. 

In fact  Clifford has been shown to occupy the entire bed of a [48-foot flatbed truck](http://i.imgur.com/3B89dIc.jpg)  making him more akin to a [Shantungosaurus](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/s/shantungosaurus.html)  one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered. On top of that  dogs are carnivores- the elephant  giraffe  and Shantungosaurus are herbivores. The largest carnivores in the world are [Kodiak Bears](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=brownbear.trivia). A male Kodiak will reach a maximum of 10 feet long  and 5 feet tall when on all fours. Clifford is nearly 30 feet tall on all fours and 50 feet long- 5 times the length and 6 times the height of a Kodiak. Imagine the power of that kind of predator being entirely managed by the wiles of a 10-year-old girl- it is unthinkable that this kind of danger would be allowed to freely roam the American suburbs unchecked.

A male Kodiak [can eat up to 90 pounds of food per day](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/bears-of-the-last-frontier/hour-one-city-of-bears/brown-bear-fact-sheet/6522/ ). Assuming Clifford's appetite is [commensurate](http://i.imgur.com/Z4NKpx4.jpg)  he would need to consume 540 pounds of food daily. Since Clifford [has been shown consuming regular dog food](http://i.imgur.com/hdYZVrG.jpg)  doing some [cursory research of bulk dog food costs](http://www.petandkennelsupply.com/dog-food/cheap-dog-food)  Clifford would need to consume about 13.5 $18.99 40lb dog food bags daily. This works out to $256.37 per day- $93 573 per year. In comparison  the [USDA estimates](http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/CostofFoodAug2014.pdf) the *monthly* cost of a family of four eating very well will max out around $1 292.80- or $15 513 per year. Clifford is then eating more than **6 times** the cost of a family of four (which is one larger than the Howard family  with Emily being an only child.)

Paying this kind of money to feed a pet is simply insane. The Howards do not appear to be overly wealthy people  living in a humble neighborhood and home. Clifford very likely is on track to eat them entirely out of house and home. And for what? The novelty of having a mammalian carnivore larger than a Tyrannosaurus Rex lurking your property to keep you safe?

It is clear  though  that Clifford is not at all concerned with safety.

Clifford is shown as generally causing a lot of serious and not at all easily ignored mayhem around his world. A basic examination of a few of his adventures turn up the following instances:

[Clifford delaying sewer repair work and putting workers at risk of injury](http://i.imgur.com/wHZGDsw.jpg)  
[Clifford crashing into cars on purpose  very probably seriously injuring the occupant](http://i.imgur.com/GKREgBc.jpg?1)  
[Clifford smashing trees and buildings for fun at a birthday party](http://i.imgur.com/v8pvty0.jpg)  
[Clifford endangering firefighters by potentially causing a backdraft by unilaterally deciding to break open the ceiling of a burning building](http://i.imgur.com/FKoReEr.jpg?1)  
[Clifford terribly misunderstanding how fires burn by blowing air on a raging inferno while firefighters are trapped on upper floors](http://i.imgur.com/Sn2NEy7.jpg)  
[Clifford damaging expensive construction projects](http://i.imgur.com/JVOOK0a.jpg?1)  
[Clifford causing collisions on highways  leading to a high potential for loss of life](http://i.imgur.com/bq1QDvc.jpg?1)  
[Clifford further unapologetic about highway chaos](http://i.imgur.com/LRhbCPI.jpg)  

[Clifford delaying infrastructure repair work while destroying private property](http://i.imgur.com/g2LNQaF.jpg)  
[Clifford potentially injuring other animals through recklessness](http://i.imgur.com/ipoT1yA.jpg)  
[Clifford cheekily endangering children to hypothermia and drowning](http://i.imgur.com/POQoa8v.jpg)  
[Clifford destroying the livelihood of poor merchants](http://i.imgur.com/IJCw8lg.jpg?1)  
[Clifford toppling telephone poles](http://i.imgur.com/a4Hl6oC.jpg?1)  
[Clifford tearing the Howard's home off its foundation in a fit of jealousy](http://i.imgur.com/xRJ6I6S.jpg)  
[Clifford wantonly smashing windows of neighborhood homes](http://i.imgur.com/Opf7M36.jpg)  
[Clifford causing havoc on mass transit systems and probable injury to innocent passengers](http://i.imgur.com/k3ICQwk.jpg)  
[Clifford callously crushing expensive  sentient  and pain-feeling robotic birthday presents bought for him](http://i.imgur.com/LQZuqmn.jpg?1)  

Now in the world of fantasy  maybe people just let this stuff go. But there have been demonstrable consequences: when Clifford eats the kite of a neighbor boy  [Mr. Howard must shell out for a new one.](http://i.imgur.com/Kzwn1wh.jpg) If he's taking financial responsibility for Clifford's actions on a small scale  it stands to reason that as the owner  he is going to be liable for damage and loss of life. The fact that Mr. Howard is not in prison  let alone allowed to keep is destructive monster of a pet  is a travesty of justice. I can't even imagine the amount of civil lawsuits he's facing.

Beyond simply the burdens put on him by his family  Clifford is simply put an absolute menace to society. He is an uncontrollably large and unknowingly strong carnivorous beast the likes of which have never been seen on planet Earth  being cared for only by a young girl. No fences  no cages  no control. Clifford is 10 feet longer and taller than a Tyrannosaurus Rex  and is not only not kept behind an electrified fence on an isolated island  he is allowed free reign of the American countryside to traverse unchecked as he sees fit.

So in closing  Clifford should not be a private pet. He should be at least in a zoo  as he is generally a friendly animal  but not be allowed to simply roam and cause death at every turn. The Howards  especially in leaving him largely in Emily's care  are deeply irresponsible as parents  citizens  and humans in allowing this. Local authorities  likely fearful of Clifford's power  have a responsibility to enjoin Federal and possibly military forces in order to secure the safety of their citizens.

"CMV: In the Matrix, Cypher was right.","IÕll base my argument on CypherÕs quote to Morpheus while he is unplugging people: ÒIf you'd told us the truth  we would've told you to shove that red pill right up your ass.Ó  First off  Cypher was of course evil to betray and murder his fellow shipmates in an attempt to get back into the Matrix  but other than that  he is totally right; and Morpheus  while claiming to offer the truth  acts like a cult leader. He only offers up enough truth for the potential followers to make an informed decision AFTER they have made an irreversible one.

LetÕs break it down this way  pretend you are in the universe of the Matrix  but you are free and perhaps you work on one of those ships.  What are you going to do with your down time?  Probably plug in to one of those training programs  like the one Mouse makes to have an intimate encounter with the woman in the red dress.  You have access to a totally immersive virtual reality entertainment at your fingertips while you live in a world that is nearly literally a hell-hole.  Sunlight is gone  there are no plants.  The surface of the planet looks like Mordor  and everyone lives cramped in some cave in the center of the earth.  Luxury and creature comforts simply do not exist.  You eat synthetic goop for every meal.  How much time do you think youÕd spend in a simulated training program  perhaps one made for entertainment instead of training?  This is especially enticing when your friends and family can join you  like the shared dreaming of the movie Inception.  I would personally spend every waking moment of free time plugged in like that.  Then suppose a race of intelligent machines comes to you and says  we can plug you into a better world all the time.  You never have to leave; all we ask in return is to use your body heat for our power plant.  I think with knowledge of such a system  90% of people would spend 90% of their time in the Matrix voluntarily.

This is what is so messed up about Morpheus and his team.  They only reveal the actual truth after it is too late to stay in the Matrix.  All he had to say was  ÒThe real world is a hell-hole  and youÕre hooked up to this machine that is making you dream that you are having a real life.  Would you rather wake up and eat goop and never see the sun again  or would you like to stay here?Ó  At least 90% of people would choose to stay.  People have an innate need to find Truth  and the Matrix as it is in the movie denies people that Truth  which I think is wrong.  But  the Machines could probably get most people to sign up for the power plant just by telling them the truth anyway.

Lastly  while Cypher did an evil thing in murdering the crew  he really only killed three people  while Trinity and Neo go and kill like 20 innocent people to save Morpheus.  This cements my view that Morpheus is like a dangerous cult leader  who lies and manipulates people to do what he wants and keep people living in the ÒrealÓ world  which is basically hell.

Anyway  CMV if you can!

tl;dr: The Matrix really is preferable to the real world  and Morpheus is wrong not to tell people the whole truth before unplugging them.

CMV: There is too much grass in the United States,"I just feel like from parks to lawns to the side of highways that grass is overused in landscaping. This post is in reference to grass that is planted by people and requires maintenance  not prairie grass  or wild grass that grows in meadows. 

1. Grass is the most irrigated crop in the United States  and more total area is covered by lawn than by crops.
2. Properly maintained grass uses a lot of fertilizer and pesticides which are bad for the environment.
3. Forests and Meadows are just as if not more aesthetically pleasing than a well-manicured grass lawn and take a lot less time and money to maintain.
4. Most people don't even take good care of their lawns  leaving them overgrown and spotted with weeds.
5. Whole regions of the United States get on just fine without having much grass.
6. A lot of grass dies in the winter and looks dumb for half the year anyway.

Edit: This is not a call to ban planting grass  just to encourage alternatives in home and public landscaping.

CMV: Chiropractors are pseudo-scientific BS,"I'll start with a personal anecdote ... When I was young  I'd crack my knuckles incessantly. I'd get an overwhelming urge in my hand joints  and would not feel comfortable until I went on a crack-a-thon. Firstly  I feel like getting manipulated by a chiropractor would cause me to get that feeling again  and force me to continue going (great for business!). However  I'll admit that this particular point is just my own anecdotal ""evidence"" ... though it's also a common thing that I hear from others.

Aside from that  it seems like joint/skeletal manipulations would only treat the symptom  rather than the cause. Wouldn't an alignment problem be more likely to be caused by a muscle imbalance  or posture/bio-mechanics issue? If so  wouldn't physical therapy  or Yoga  or just plain working out  be a better long-term solution to the problems that chiropractors claim to solve? 

The main reason I'm asking  is because people claim to receive such relief from chiropractors (including people I respect) ... that I'd hate to dismiss something helpful just because my layman's intuition is wrong.

"CMV: I despise advertising, and think the people who work in it are scum.","Final Edit: Man  not even two hours and you guys pretty much blew me out of the water. Is that typical?

Alright  first things first  I apologize to anyone I offended by calling them scum. I certainly came in here all pissed and half-cocked. In my defense  I can't seem to work up the courage to talk about many subjects unless I have a full head of mad to get me going.

 From what I've gathered  there's many MANY different types of advertising  and I seem to take issue with the more capitalistic oriented ones  or just capitalism in general. My trust issues and paranoia (disabled veteran with 8 anxiety and depression disorders  see a therapist once a week) certainly weren't helping. 

I want to thank everyone who responded  and I sincerely want to thank everyone for not just ripping into me for my blind hate  as would have been kinda justifiable. I have a TON to think about now  and I'll do my best to award everyone delta's for getting me to think differently. There's a lot here to mull over  however  so please forgive me if it takes a while.

First: I'm sorry if this sounds like soapboxing. The topic gets me VERY angry  and is one of the reasons why I'm willing to discuss it. I apologize if I went overboard and it needs to be taken down. It should probably also be noted that I have some problems with being overly literal-minded  which may explain part of my frustrations.



I find advertising to be infuriating. I find it manipulative  dishonest  and completely uncaring. Advertising is never just about talking about your product and what it does  its more than that. There's always some subtle manipulation  like everyone in the advertisement is extremely attractive  or the person that needs the product has a defect of some sort. It can even be innocent such as ""x product helps your hair stay healthier  and we all hate split ends right?"" Even something as simple as that is still manipulating your way of thinking and trying to get you to think and feel a certain way to want that product. They don't care about their product  they just want your money. I have never seen an advertisement that didn't try to exploit SOME fear or anxiety  completely unnecessary problem that no one deserves to live with. There is never any trust in the product  there is always SOME method employed to make it more appealing. There's even manipulation done to lie about what the product does without ACTUALLY saying any lies! It's never just ""X body spray covers body odore with a nice fragrance."" Instead  the dude covers himself in the spray  and suddenly ladies are everywhere. Sure  they're still talking about the product normally  not embellishing or anything! ""But boy  that guy sure is covered in bitches  I gotta gets me some X body spray so I can be covered in bitches too!"" And all the advertisers care about is the poor fool who believes that and buys the product.

I simply cannot understand how anyone can work in advertising  and not hate themselves or not just be a shitty person. It honestly feels like a single step above a scam artist. Even if I had no choice and had to work an advertising job just to live  I certainly wouldn't like it  or myself. 

The reason why I bring this up is because my wife made a friend who works in advertising. When her friend told me this  I actually walked away from him with a snarl. I tried to talk to him about it  but I can't seem to discuss it (in person at least) without getting absolutely blind with rage. I start shaking  sputtering  and cursing  which tells me I have some serious hate here. Kinda like to see the other side of things.

Edit: Holy crap  more popular than expected. Doing my best to read and process everything.

CMV: It was a mistake for Disneyland to replace the Tower of Terror with a Guardians of the Galaxy ride.,"Earlier this year Disneyland closed the *The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror* and replaced it with a ÒnewÓ attraction called *Guardians of the Galaxy-Mission: Breakout!* Many Disney fans  myself included  were very sad to hear that Disneyland was about to lose one of its best big-ticket rides  but I withheld judgment until I was able to ride it for myself. After all  it's more or less the same ""ride""  just with a new theme.

But overall  I was disappointed  and the ride feels like a step back. The Tower of Terror was one of the biggest draws to the park. IÕm a fan of the MCU and I enjoyed both GotG movies  but feels pretty obvious that they took an old concept and shoehorned the GotG into it. They would have done better to have developed a new GotG ride from the ground up.

1) **Tower of Terror had a better story.**

The story to Tower of Terror was simple. ÒFive people disappeared from a haunted hotel elevator years ago  youÕre about to ride the same elevator.Ó ThatÕs all you need to know. Even if you've never seen an episode of The Twilight Zone in your life you can easily pick up the plot.

Guardians of the Galaxy plot is far more convoluted. ThereÕs a preshow video in the queue explaining the characters and the plot  but itÕs very  very long and hard to follow. I rode with my sister  who had not seen any of the movies  and I had to keep pausing in line to explain who the characters are  and why we care about them. And the actual ride doesn't tie in that well. What does an elevator ride have to do with any of this? (WeÕre going to turn off the generator  or something. That part wasn't quite clear.)

2) **Tower of Terror has a better theme.**

It fit very well with the Òold-school HollywoodÓ theme in the park. It was one of the best examples of world-building in the whole Disneyland resort.

Everything in the queue slowly adds to the creepiness  slowly builds up the suspense to the actual ride. Guardians is nice  but it doesn't have the same charm. ItÕs fun  at least. But itÕs *only* a movie tie-in  and it never really rises above that level.

The special effects on Tower of Terror were more memorable. When your elevator stops in front of a mirror and Òwave goodbye to the real worldÓ  the mirror gets struck by lightning and your reflection disappears. Each room had depth and got progressively creepier.

Guardians has you stop at floors with clips of the characters fighting bad guys  but not a lot is done to disguise the fact that youÕre just looking at a giant TV. ItÕs adequate  but thereÕs no *edge* to it.

ItÕs good enough for a family-oriented theme park  but it doesn't create a lasting experience. YouÕre just goofing around with some movie characters. I rode GotG four times and IÕd be hard pressed to tell you what happened in any of the cutscenes. The Twilight Zone mirror scene  on the other hand  is unforgettable.

3) **Tower of Terror is a better ride.**

One of the features of GotG is that instead of one script every time  you can get one of six songs  each with a different drop profile. In most of them  thereÕs no longer a big drop from the top of the shaft to the bottom. You instead make a bunch of smaller rises and drops. Some are great; ParliamentÕs Get Up the Funk drop profile is appropriately bouncy. Others aren't so fun. Free Ride by The Edgar Winter Group has more drops  but theyÕre shorter  jerkier  and more headache-inducing. 

The trouble is that you have no way to choose which drop profile you get. You could wait 90 minutes in line and get stuck on Free Ride. The Tower of Terror only had one drop profile  but it benefited from a suspenseful build-up. When you finally dropped  it was a blast and very satisfying. 

IÕm not saying GotG is some sort of a train wreck. It isn't. ItÕs still fun. ItÕs 80% the same experience.

But itÕs inferior to the Tower of Terror. GotG would have been better served by creating its own ride from the ground up. The California Adventure park would have been better served by *adding* another ride  not *replacing* its largest ride.

Where am I wrong? What are the silver linings to the new GotG ride?

CMV: Asking me to leave the toilet seat down for their convenience is no different than me asking someone to leave it up for my convenience.,"First of all  this is not a post about gender equality  its about how to respectfully leave the bathroom for the next person. I am all for equal rights for men and women. I am not one of those rant and rave redpill folks. I think men  women  transgender or whoever you are deserves to be treated with the same respect. And that is where this view comes from. How is asking me to put the toilet seat down for her convenience  any different from me asking a woman to put it back up when she's done for my convenience? It only takes like 2 seconds to change the position of the seat anyway so why not just leave it as you leave it? Or if you think it should be left for the next person's convenience it would actually make more sense to leave it up if you have more men in your house than women because we pee more often than we poop so the up position will be more necessary. But really  it takes like 2 seconds.

EDIT: Holy shit this was not something I expected to blow up like this. I appreciate all the feedback.

"CMV: in chess, stalemate should be a loss for the side that can't move","In chess  a stalemate occurs when one side cannot make a legal move  or in other words  any move they could make would place their king into check.  The current rules of chess say when this happens  the game ends in a draw.  

However  I think the spirit of the game is that the goal is to capture the enemy king.  Checkmate means there is no way to avoid the king getting captured on the next move  and stalemate means there is no way to avoid it the move after next.  But both should lead to the same result  a win for the side which will capture the opponent's king.",156,2,3,20,24,"[['video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qghxtx9wzqi)'], ['rules](https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=171&view=article)'], ['video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unrmmktlpjo).)'], ['^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/fcrfs94k/62484)'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tempo_(chess))'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalemate#proposed_rule_change'], ['""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalemate#history_of_the_stalemate_rule)'], ['persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shatranj)', 'chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_chess),', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalemate#history_of_the_stalemate_rule', '[stalemate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janggi#ending_the_game)'], ['[stalemate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalemate).'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['1913:229,267)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalemate#history_of_the_stalemate_rule)'], ['[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalemate#more_complex_examples)'], ['possible.](http://www.apronus.com/chess/diagram/stagram.php?d=pkn______rp_p____pppp____p_p__________________________k__________)'], ['possible.](http://www.apronus.com/chess/diagram/stagram.php?d=pkn______rp_p____pppp____p_p__________________________k__________)'], ['chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janggi#ending_the_game),'], ['chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janggi#ending_the_game),'], ['how.](http://www.apronus.com/chess/diagram/arrowgram.php?de=60&a=rnbqkbnrhpppppppph8h8h8h8hpppppppphrnbqkbnr_rnbqkbnrhpppppppph8h8h8hp7h1ppppppphrnbqkbnr_rnbqkbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h8hp7h1ppppppphrnbqkbnr_rnbqkbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp7h1ppp1ppphrnbqkbnr_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p2qhp7h1ppp1ppphrnbqkbnr_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p2qhp7h1pppkppphrnbq1bnr_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp7h1pppkppqhrnbq1bnr_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp2k4h1ppp1ppqhrnbq1bnr_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp2k4h1ppp1pp1hrnbq1bnq_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1k5h1ppp1pp1hrnbq1bnq_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1k5h1ppp1pp1hrnbq1bq1_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hpk6h1ppp1pp1hrnbq1bq1_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hpk6h1ppp1pq1hrnbq1b2_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp7hkppp1pq1hrnbq1b2_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp7hkppp1p2hrnbq1q2_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n5hkppp1p2hr1bq1q2_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n5hkppp1q2hr1bq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n5h1ppp1q2hrkbq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n5h1ppp2q1hrkbq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n5hrppp2q1h1kbq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n4qhrppp4h1kbq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n4qhrppp4hk1bq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp1n3q1hrppp4hk1bq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp5q1hrppp4hknbq4_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p3h4p3hp7hrppp4hknbq2q1_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p2qh4p3hp7hrppp4hknb3q1_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p2qh4p3hp7hrppp4hknq5_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p2qh4p3hp1p5hrp1p4hknq5_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppph8h4p2qh4p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbnrhpppp1ppqh8h4p3h4p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbnrh1ppp1ppqh8hp3p3h4p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbnqh1ppp1pp1h8hp3p3h4p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbnqh1ppp1pp1h8h4p3hp3p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbn1h1ppp1pq1h8h4p3hp3p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbn1h2pp1pq1h8h1p2p3hp3p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbq1h2pp1p2h8h1p2p3hp3p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kbq1h2pp1p2h8h4p3hpp2p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnb1kb2h2pp1q2h8h4p3hpp2p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnbk1b2h2pp1q2h8h4p3hpp2p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnbk1b2h2pp4h8h4pq2hpp2p3hp1p5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnbk1b2h2pp4h8h4pq2hp3p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnbk1b2h2pp4h8h4q3hp3p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rnbk1b2h3p4h8h2p1q3hp3p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rqbk1b2h3p4h8h2p5hp3p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_rqbk1b2h3p4h8h8hp1p1p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_q1bk1b2h3p4h8h8hp1p1p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_q1bk1b2h8h8h3p4hp1p1p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_1qbk1b2h8h8h3p4hp1p1p3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_1qbk1b2h8h8h8hp1ppp3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_q1bk1b2h8h8h8hp1ppp3hppp5hrp1p4hkn2q3_q1bk1b2h8h8h8hp1p1p3hpppp4hrp1p4hkn2q3_2qk1b2h8h8h8hp1p1p3hpppp4hrp1p4hkn2q3_2q2b2h4k3h8h8hp1p1p3hpppp4hrp1p4hkn2q3_5q2h4k3h8h8hp1p1p3hpppp4hrp1p4hkn2q3_5k2h8h8h8hp1p1p3hpppp4hrp1p4hkn2q3_5k2h8h8h4p3hp1p5hpppp4hrp1p4hkn2q3_5k2h8h8h4p3hp1p5hpppp4hrp1p4hkn3q2_5k2h8h4p3h8hp1p5hpppp4hrp1p4hkn3q2_5k2h5q2h4p3h8hp1p5hpppp4hrp1p4hkn6_5k2h5p2h8h8hp1p5hpppp4hrp1p4hkn6_8h5k2h8h8hp1p5hpppp4hrp1p4hkn6)', 'link](http://www.apronus.com/chess/pgnviewer/?m=a3_e5_e4_qh4_ke2_qxh2_kd3_qxh1_kc3_qxg1_kb3_qxg2_ka2_qxf1_nc3_qxf2_kb1_qg2_ra2_qh3_ka1_qg3_nb1_qg1_qh5_qxc1_c3_qe1_qxh7_a5_qxh8_a4_qxg7_b5_qxg8_b4_qxf7*_kd8_qf5_b3_qxe5_c5_qxb8_c4_qxa8_d5_qb8_d4_qa8_d3_qxc8*_ke7_qxf8*_kxf8_e5_qf1_e6_qf7_exf7_kxf7),'], ['](http://www.apronus.com/chess/diagram/editor/?f=&d=a________________________________________________pr______kb______0&w=8&h=8&z=w)is']]",0,41,0,No
CMV: Cold advertising by placing leaflets/fliers on windshields should be considered littering and carry heavy fines for businesses.,"Parking in a public space is not consent to allow people to touch one's property. Nor do most people consent to what amounts to having trash  that was not theirs to begin with placed upon their vehicle. To simplify this situation  I think it should be a fineable offense that punitively punishes businesses in excess of the cost of printing leaflets and possibly something more on top to discourage the practice. Especially since I imagine no small amount of individuals actively throw those leaflets right onto the ground  drive off with them still attached only to be blown off or any other form of removal that doesn't land them in a trashcan. The outright environmental cost here  probably far outweighs the benefits of blind advertising to people by putting trash onto their vehicles. It's a practice best left behind.

"CMV: People who are known assholes get more leniency than ""kind"" people who just happen to slip up.","There's a few people in my group of friends who have screwed over  other friends and when it's found out  the backlash is expected  but never lasts long. However  There are people who have fucked up maybe ONCE and everyone seems to hang it over their head forever  even if it's less severe. I notice the same thing with public figures. For example  its much easier For Justin Bieber to be forgiven than say  Dwayne Johnson. It's like people get more upset that you acted contrary to their expectations than they are of the actual offence/ frequency of offences.

Only kids seem to order that drink.  Most people in their 30's and 40's avoid it because it's seen as immature. 

But why?

Is it because of the sugar?  It has no more sugar than soda (which is acceptable at a bar setting)  or your average Joe's coffee?  It's no worse for your insulin than liquor. 

Because of the milk?  Perhaps milk is seen as childish because  by definition  it is created to nourish the young.  But milk is nutritious  supplying you with Vitamin D and protein.

What makes a kids drink and an adults drink?  Perhaps the advertising campaigns of how Nesquick (with the cartoony bunny rabbit) has a monopoly over the market.  Who knows.

But  if we add coffee and ice to chocolate milk  then you get Starbucks  which isn't kiddy.

This makes no f---ing sense!

CMV: I won't lie to my child about Santa.,"I can't reconcile with myself my want to be honest with my child and the Santa Clause myth. I have no problem with telling my child that Santa isn't real. I am however concerned that my child would ruin the 
myth for other children. 

Benefits of not lying to my child I imagine would be a more trusting relationship  a greater sense of gratefullness for what they recive at Christmas and they would never be disappointed when they discover the truth. 

On balance  I believe my right to tell my child the truth trumps another parent's right to have their child's belief unspoiled.

"CMV: Reddit has devolved to a false dichotomy of left vs right, and has little room for moderates; or rather The_Donald is the exact same type of ""safe space"" against which they rail.","r/The_Donald is what I would call the ""right"" of reddit  and r/politcs the ""left"" of reddit.  Mods of r/politics widely censor posts that don't fall in line with specific view points.  However  r/The_Donald is just as bad.  I have been banned from r/The_Donald for identifying as a supporter of Bernie Sanders.  I wasn't even disparaging Trump as a candidate  only commenting how how I think the system is rigged. As such  I believe The_Donald is worse than r/politics when it comes to censoring and banning people because as it's side bar states ""AfterBerners (Former BernieBots) MUST Assimilate.""

They have literally created the safe space where any user who leaves not a conflicting view  but merely identifies themself as an outsider  will be banned.  Thus  while comments are not necessarily censored or removed (they maybe for all I know)  the user is banned.  This is the literal equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling ""LALALALALALALA"" so you don't have to hear a conflicting opinion.

The point is  the major subreddits have devolved into a left/right schism  just like Fox News/MSNBC  where when even a reasonable counter point is brought up  it is condescendingly ignored.

To be honest  I'm expecting to be ignored by r/politics  but as an independent who will not vote Hillary  I'm having trouble finding any reason to support a group who is deliberately obtuse when it comes to discussing issues.

Edit: Holy shit  I just searched for a r/independent to see if I can find some like minded individuals  and it has been banned.

CMV: I think subreddits shouldn't auto ban based on if you posted on another subreddits.,"**edit for the mods:** this post isn't really about the upcoming election.

I'm permanently banned from /r/Offmychest  /r/Feminisms  /r/Blackladies  /r/Racism  /r/Rape  /r/Naturalhair  /r/Blackhair  /r/Interracialdating  and /r/antira apparently.

I got banned from these for jokingly posting on /r/kotakuinaction because someone linked to that sub in a comment  I clicked on it  read the warning and jokingly saying something along the lines of ""I wonder if I'll get banned for doing nothing more than posting on this sub""

I understood the consequences of posting on that sub  and I don't really mind because any sub that would be willing to ban a user just for posting on another sub is a sub I probably wouldn't be interested in joining. It would have been bad if I had been banned from something like /r/leagueoflegends  but that's not important.

After asking about what /r/kotakuinaction is about  they seem like rational people. But there are rational people in just about every group  so I can't say the entire sub is like that. Just like I can't say every Donald Trump supporter is a rational person because I've met a few who informed me of Trump's policies which  while I don't agree with some of them  are more sensible than what a lot of media is making out his policies to be.

I don't agree with banning people based on the subreddits they choose to participate in. Yes there are people who would go on those specific subs and spread messages that run counter to that sub's content  but to ban an entire group of people for that reason is just an over generalization. 

Secondly  why should what I say or do in another sub have anything to do with another sub in the first place? While I don't have controversial opinions like hating black people  hating fat people or just hating a certain group of people in general  I think those people deserve to have their subs if they keep to themselves. If I'm not discussing my viewpoint which would offend a certain sub on that certain sub  or anywhere else on Reddit for that matter  I don't think I should be banned for it.

I'm getting tired so I'm going to stop replying. I'll reply again when I wake up tomorrow.

CMV: Real-time debates suck because they rely on off-the-top of your head thinking and are only good for being theatrical.,"Real-time debates are a terrible way to pit two positions against each other. They are only good if you want to show a dramatic or theatrical scene  which is why networks use them. If you aren't interested in providing entertainment and actually want to put forth an intellectually stimulating and thoughtful way to put two positions against each other  then you should use a different format. An example one off the top of my head (get it?) would be to have both contestants make statements in turn  one-at-a-time  and a contestant can take some time -- maybe a few hours -- to analyze and debunk/research the preceeding statement by their opponent. Not only is the memory aspect of debating removed (which balances the playing field)  but it also removes interruptions and talking over others. It would also allow panelists to come across clearly and avoid making mistakes and saying stupid stuff.

Debating in real-time is largely just theater and while it may be a good way to showcase the key points of your position and to watch some drama  it is a hugely ineffectual way to pit two positions against each other. You can hide secret facts from your opponent like an ace up your sleeve  use them in a debate  and your opponent -- not because there is no counterargument  but because *they cannot recall one off the top of their head* -- will be stumped or unsure how to respond and portrayed/thought of as debunked or defeated. Come on  that's completely unfair.

I doubt networks will stop doing these debates anytime soon because you need em views. If you aren't an entertainment network and if you are truly interested in seeing two positions go head-to-head  debating in real-time is not a good format. CMV that I have little faith and stock in these debates.

"CMV: Apple is approaching a complacent plateau, similar to Microsoft 10 years ago.","Iconic CEO gone.  Less innovative CEO in.  Profits have been soaring  but there's been a lull in innovation and competition has also been rising.

Phones and tablets are a mature market  yet Apple still relies on them for a majority of their revenue.  Their desktop industry is vanishing.  Their laptop industry is holding on  although the past 2 years have been horrible for Macbooks in a wide variety of ways between the controversial keyboards  absence of ports  dated specs  high prices  cheap display on the MBA.  Even their iPhone has been playing catchup for the past several years.  They haven't really made any large strides forward in their products in the past 3 years.

Apple really has not much else to go.  The car is the no-go.  Google and other companies beat them to the ""internet of things"" industries.  

Apple seems to be entrenched in tablets and not really pursuing much else  and it may cost them.

CMV: Committing suicide because of depression isn't selfish,"People have no idea what that person is going through but shove their view that this person should think about how other would feel?

Have you ever thought about how he or she feels?! Do you think they want to be depressed? Do you think they wanted to feel that way? While everyone can live their day relatively normally  everyday is a living nightmare for them and I'm saying this from experience as someone who was diagnosed with depression and has to take medicine.

But no. They have to continue just so other people can have a good conscience and live their lives not understanding how much pain the other party is feeling. That is selfish. Wanting someone to continue hurting themselves not because you care about them but because you'll feel bad... THAT'S SELFISH! You're not considering the pain they feel but prioritizing your own!

CMV: Tipping should be done away with,"Giving gratuities to service workers is an unnecessarily confusing custom. A gratuity  by definition  is voluntary  so they aren't something that should be expected or mandated. The only place where a tip is really expected and a lack thereof stigmatized is the United States. This can be a constant source of confusion for people from other countries where it's not customary.

I can see a reason for tipping in some cases where it's obvious that the reason for the tip is distinct from the reason for the charge on the bill. For example:  
* The bill at a restaurant is for the food  while the tip is for service  
* The bill for food delivery is for the food  while the tip is for delivery  
* The bill at a hotel is for the room  while the tip is for the housekeepers who clean it for you

However  there are some cases where I can't tell why we tip. Why do we tip taxi drivers or barbers? Tipping service workers isn't consistent across the board either. No one tips the cashier or bagger at the grocery store.

In my view  the tipping custom should be done away with and employers should satisfy the minimum wage for workers without counting any tips from customers. If this means that the prices for the resources are raised  or an extra service charge is included as a result  so be it. Having the amount I have to pay be clearly displayed to me would be much more efficient and less confusing.

CMV: Coins should be placed into hands before notes.,"After purchasing items  shop tellers insist on places the notes of the change first  then resting the coins on top. This is wrong and thoroughly annoying.

* When coins are put on notes they slide around and risk falling onto the floor.
* People put notes away first as coins need your full attention to slide into your pocket/purse and so should be more readily available.
* If you wish to use two hands it is harder since you can't carefully pick the coins off the notes but it would be easy to pick the notes out of the other hand if they were on top of the coins

By ensuring people get to put away their change quickly  other shoppers will be able to make their purchase quicker. This will save time and make people less annoyed at people scrambling with their change after buying somethnig.

CMV: American Cartoons aimed at Adults are more immature and less creative than Cartoons aimed at Kids on average,"When I look at the comparison of animated works in the states  especially compared to anime I feel like American Cartoons on average tend to thinks that being R rated  means it has to be a raunchy comedy. American Cartoons in general have a stigma to them that because of it having the rating that it does it means it must be this style.

Sometimes this can work to it's advantage  South Park does this but it works very much to it's own advantage. It supposed to be over the top and ridiculous but also is smart enough to know how to give a comical satire of our real world. Bojack Horseman shows how bad and messed up we can be and what even Hollywood can do to people when you loose yourself. I don't think many other american shows do this.

I've seen one season of Rick and Morty  and I don't think it is bad and appreciate what it does  it also delves heavy into the body humor of a space fart cloud  going for lots of low brow humor. South Park does it as well but I think it works better there. Don't get me wrong  it's not a bad show at all in my eyes but it does go down the road that I think is a stigma of lots of ""mature"" cartoons in the states. 

Then there is Family guy which absolutely fits this stigma especially in the recent seasons. It goes down the being crass and cude humor with random cutaways but really has not much to justify it's for adults. But that feels like such a waste here and in fact is actually really immature. Big Mouth is another show that has popped up that is ""For adults"" but honestly is more childish than most of the animated stuff I see for adults. It wants to try and tackle stuff like puberty but it doesn't seem to have much focus on it nor make sense with the monster concept.

On top of it  what is the deal with trying to purposely make adult shows ugly as sin or unappealing with art style? In shows like Bojack  yeah he has moments where he is unsightly and not supposed to look appealing. But art styles like big mouth and the like go for a lot of this and gross out humor a lot. Why? Why is it mostly adult shows that because they are for an older audience they go for more sexual gross out all the time? 

Then you get movies like Sausage Party that really pissed me off because it was winking and nodding at the camera that it was rated R. Like this is some magical revelation that nothing like this has ever been seen. Well unless you watch anime like me and have seen hentai  Berserk  Ghost in the Shell  Ecchi anime  Akira  blood bath anime and such. This is nothing new  it's been done before. 

When I compare this to other shows like Avatar the Last Airbender  Batman the Animated Series  Steven Universe  Adventure Time  hell I'd even add in Regular Show which is supposed to be random nonsense as being more adult in personal situations and topics. I've seen plenty of anime and on average I'd say a lot of really great anime like Death Parade  Cowboy Bebop  Fullmetal Alchemist  Trigun  Boy and the Beast  Wolf Children. 

Hell I just recently finished an anime known as Recovery of an MMO Junkie  which tackled the topic of online relationships and how to return to being a functional person after becoming a shut in. Nothing most american ""adult"" cartoons do even comes close to looking at mature or topics like this. 

American adult cartoons use it as an excuse to  we can be edgier and raunchier but in turn  end up being a lot more childish than most anime and even cartoons aimed at kids.

"CMV: Islam is NOT a violent religion, and all the Quran's violent verses are taken out of context.","First of all  I want to start off by saying that I'm agnostic. I don't believe in Islam  and I think it's a man-made religion. In fact  I used to hate Islam. After reading all its ""violent"" verses in context  however  it's become obvious to me that the Quran strongly states that fighting is permitted ONLY when you're under attack and your life is in danger.

Here are some common verses that people point out when they want to prove how violent Islam is  and I'll address them one by one:

""And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you  and fitnah is worse than killing.""

This is immediately followed by ""But if they cease  then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors "" which makes it clear that fighting/killing is only permitted you're being attacked.

A few sentences later  we see this: ""So whoever has assaulted you  then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you "" which means the Muslims were being assaulted when the above verse was written.

""I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved  so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.""

If you read this sentence from the very beginning of the verse  you'll see this: ""[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels  ""I am with you  so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved  so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip."" This shows that this verse is addressed to the angels  commanding them to punish the wrong-doers in hell.

""Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows  while you know not.""

This is followed by: ""They ask you about the sacred month - about fighting therein. Say  ""Fighting therein is great [sin]  but averting [people] from the way of Allah and disbelief in Him and [preventing access to] al-Masjid al-Haram and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of Allah. And fitnah is greater than killing."" **And they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able.""** This shows that not only were the Muslims under attack at the time this verse was written  but also the attackers were trying to forcefully convert the Muslims to another religion and were preventing them from praying at their Mosque.

Another verse that proves my point: ""And if Allah had willed  He could have given them power over you  and they would have fought you. **So if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace  then Allah has not made for you a cause [for fighting] against them.""**

Muslim terrorists take these verses out of context to justify their violence. However  it's clear that they're doing the opposite of what's stated in the Quran  because they're always the aggressors and the people who are killed by them were not attacking them before they were killed. Those people who say terrorists are not TRUE Muslims might actually have a point.",463,3,3,56,93,"[['jesus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criticism_of_jesus),',

CMV: Mass migration and the refugee crisis is an existential threat to Europe's future,"Following France's election of Macron over Le Pen  it was viewed by many pundits as a rejection of far-right xenophobia. But my view is that leaders like Le Pen are the only ones who are willing to go far enough in addressing what is a massive problem for Europe. There are huge communities of recent migrants that are not integrating into society  and the second and third generations don't appear to be any more integrated than the first. 

I worry that importing millions of people every year into Europe who have fundamnetally different worldviews on issues like sexism  anti-Semitism  free speech  and liberal democracy is a threat to European values. I'm scared of what Europe will look like in another few decades if immigration remains loose  and I feel like we need strong leaders to stem the tide. But I'd love to be proved wrong so please CMV!

CMV: Students who receive no financial aid from their parents should be able to declare independent on their FAFSA.,"**Preface Edit:** This is pretty much solved in my opinion-- my view hasn't been changed but I will still read and reply as I can this weekend. Edit 3 basically perfectly describes the whole situation.


I really wanna talk more about this. Surely I'm missing something. I have three major issues:

1. You're screwing the kid over  plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100 000/year and don't wanna pay for college  you are quite simply screwed.

2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That's the most unstable part of your young adult life.

3. People aren't stupid  they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5 500+ a year and middle class people don't. ""You just got that money because you're poor."" ""I wish my parents were poor!"" I hear this shit all the time.

These are some basic arguments because I feel like I'm missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.

**Edit:** Well  I've only had reasons added to my list.

4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I'm describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.

5. To go with that  a student has no control over their parents  and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.

6. To top that piece off  you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.

If we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life  why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?

**Edit 2:**

1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.

**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I'm just getting really tired  I was pretty tired in the first place and didn't expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I'd be handy dandy  but nope!)

>What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn't have to be easy  and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information  obviously  but it also means no living with the family over the summer  no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW)  no trips with family without personal receipts  and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans  allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system  it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit  and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)
To some degree  yes  any such system can be gamed. However  there's a pretty clear limit  and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it  but in comparison to what a ""rich"" family can provide it's a relatively small amount. Sure  a rich family could withdraw support in order to ""score"" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime)  but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers  especially with the amount of effort involved.
Is all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure  but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.
Basically  I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure  it might not be easy  but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.

And that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I'm after.

CMV: It is hypocritical to call oneself pro-life yet not support healthcare as a basic human right,"I really don't understand how somebody can consider themselves pro-life yet be against universal healthcare.  Shouldn't someone who is pro-life support 100% any and all means of providing a longer and more enjoyable life?

The only way that I could imagine someone not being hypocritical is if they freely admit that ""pro-life"" is just a euphemism for ""pro-fetus"".  You could change my view if you are pro-life and admit that the term is just a euphamism  as well as provide others who think along the same lines.

Edit: Posting this here to clarify my opinions.  

Imagine you are given a choice between pushing a button and saving someones life  or not pushing the button and thereby killing them. In this case  the death of the individual is the result of your inaction and opposed to action.

If you elect to not push the button  is that the same as murdering them? You were perfectly able to push the button and save their lives. (lets assume that whether you push the button or not  there will be no repercussions for you except for any self-imposed guilt/shame)

In my mind  healthcare is that button. There are many people that are losing their lives in the USA because they do not want their familes to face the grotesque financial implications that they will incur due to seeking out the healthcare. By not supporting healthcare as a human right  you are morally condemning those people to death. You could argue that it was their choice not to go into debt  but I would argue that the current status quo of society forced their hand.",352,2,2,14,23,"[['supply](https://www.google.com/search?q=doctors+leave+country+for+better+pay).', '([pick](https://www.google.com/search?q=british+health+care+problems)', '[source](https://www.google.com/search?q=canada+health+care+problems))', 'said.](https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government)'], ['deaths](http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/24/us/senator-va-report/).', 'locations](http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/defunding-planned-parenthood-leads-increase-low-income-births-texas).', 'hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-world_hypothesis)'], ['best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avf1q3uidwm)'], ['cost-effective.*](http://www.channel4.com/news/drugs-life-breast-cancer-nice-20-000-a-year-of-life-nhs)'], ['ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consistent_life_ethic)""', 'life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_life).""'], ['terms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative_and_positive_rights)'], ['[source](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp1002985).'], ['observable](http://www.npinstitute.com/public-vs-private-hospitals-s/1852.htm).', 'school](http://i.imgur.com/nf42wbs.jpg).', 'community](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1920&bih=955&q=atlantic+station).', 'project](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1920&bih=955&q=cabriniÐgreen).'], ['http://www.nber.org/papers/w13429.pdf'], ['abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_defense_of_abortion)'], ['supermarkets.](http://i.imgur.com/xwouu8g.gif)'], ['unpopular](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=id+est&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3b%2cid%20est%3b%2cc0)'], ['[this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/embryo,_8_cells.jpg)?'], ['5:11-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers%205&version=niv).']]",1,58,1,No
CMV: People who mod their cars to be insanely loud are douchebags.,"Ever since I was old enough to notice things like this I could just never understand why there were so many people who modified their cars to be extremely  obnoxiously  loud.  I suppose instead of saying ÔpeopleÕ I should say teenage boys through the age of men in their mid-twenties.  I do understand that there are in fact people who take an interest in tinkering with their cars and  they take great pride in their work and perhaps there could be a reasonable cause for the loudness (result of badass engine?). Honestly though we all know they can buy some exhaust kit online  this doesnÕt count as a person who puts sweat into their car. So letÕs be me for a moment and only see that all of these cars can be seen peeling out of the 7-11 parking lot (also their preferred hangout spot) with some d-bag almost wearing a hat  smoking a cig  trying their best to look menacing  oh and thereÕs trashy girls in the backseat.

Change my mind  tell me that it is me who is the douchebag.  Tell me why the 16-23ish year olds who are cruising around in a 9 year old Civic blowing out the eardrums of nearby victims deserves better judgment.

"CMV: The Rolling Stone ""rape article"" controversy is not a commentary on the failures of feminism, but on the failures of media sensationalism.","My argument is that the failures of Rolling Stone in their reporting of the fake UVA rape story have nothing to do with a world in which feminism has gotten out of control  and have everything to do with a world in which media sensationalism has gotten out of control. I will touch on a few other aspects of this story as well  so bear with me. I will not bother summarizing the story in its entirety  as I will assume you the reader know what I'm talking about. [An excellent in-depth review of the story and Rolling Stone's failures](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-what-went-wrong-20150405) was written by an outside source and then published in Rolling Stone yesterday. The report is damning  and I recommend it to everyone if you have the time.

I was struck by the comments on r/news about this story yesterday. Most of the top comments blamed feminism for this journalistic disaster  such as [this top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/31kbp6/no_firings_at_rolling_stone_over_flawed_story_a/cq2h3es) (currently at 2 191 points and 5 gildings) which starts with the words ""Feminists and social justice warriors."" I'm unsure where that conclusion is coming from  so I'd like to address my conclusion.

If you read that damning report of Rolling Stone's failures  you'll see that they skipped over a number of policies they would have normally followed. The student who claimed to be raped  Jackie  told the reporter that she had discussed the incident with friends of hers. It was later revealed after the story's publication that Jackie had given her friends an entirely different account of what had happened that night. But the reporter and Rolling Stone's editors did not make a sufficient attempt to contact her friends. If they had  the story would have quickly fallen apart. Jackie had even given her friends the name of someone who didn't really exist  whereas she had refused to divulge a name to the reporter. If this had been explored at all  the falseness of the whole thing would have been exposed right away. Worst of all  Rolling Stone's article was phrased in a way that made it sound like they really had interviewed Jackie's friends by failing to mention that all quotes of these friends published in the article came from Jackie herself. Do you see where the sensationalism is creeping in? The article wouldn't have had a rich narrative structure if it had to keep interrupting itself with the disclaimer that all these supposed facts came from Jackie herself  and only Jackie. We all know which version of that article gets the most clicks  and Rolling Stone undermined the journalistic process when they sought clicks over veracity.

But none of this has anything to do with feminism or what feminism says about how alleged rape victims should be treated. Alleged rape victims really should be treated with full trust  at least until they name the perpetrator (more on this in a bit). The consequences of believing a mentally ill person's made up story about an anonymous rapist are far outweighed by the potentially traumatic consequences of being skeptical about a real rape victim's story. Real rape victims  male and female  have a number of reasons to refrain from telling their story (social taboos  fear of repercussion  outside pressures  personal feelings of unworthiness and disgust  etc.)  and society should therefore be as welcoming as possible when it comes to letting alleged rape victims talk about their trauma. Yes there will be crazy people like Jackie who make it all up for attention  but we cannot treat real victims with undeserved skepticism because of a few bad apples. In this way  no one who interacted with Jackie was at all at fault  except for Rolling Stone. Her friends rightly believed her  because who wouldn't trust a friend in a time of need like that? What would be the benefit of doing so  going back to my point about consequences earlier? The school did the right thing in providing her with counseling  and it never even pursued action against the fraternity she named. 

[A sidenote: I do believe the university should have issued a warning to its students about a possible fraternity-related sexual assault happening on their campus  even though it turned out to be false  for the same reason that universities must make their students aware of bomb threats no matter the veracity - ""better safe than sorry"" to put it simply. By not making their students aware of this possible sexual assault  they left their students in danger if the story had been true. This is one failing that I think the original Rolling Stone article gets correct  and there are numerous other cases of UVA failing to address sexual assault properly involving incidents which really happened.]

So now we ask ourselves: where did Rolling Stone go wrong? In my opinion  their biggest mistake was to publish the story without knowing the name of the person who raped Jackie. In the damning report of their failures  this point is brought up again and again: Jackie did not want to provide the name of her rapist. Now for a friend or school counselor  this would not be the time to express skepticism. Again  there are real rape victims who find it very difficult to talk about their attackers  and if they don't want to pursue criminal charges that should be their decision (hopefully real victims can be convinced  but badgering them does no good). So the consequences of letting women lie for sympathy are not as bad as making real rape victims feel unwilling to talk about their trauma  as I mentioned above. But when an alleged rapist is *named * everything changes. Now it has become a direct accusation  and as with all other crimes  the accuser must be subject to skepticism. This isn't a pleasant process  but it is a necessary one. And I think that journalistic institutions have a similar responsibility when it comes to allegations of rape. When Jackie refused to give the name of her rapist  Rolling Stone shouldn't have pressed harder  nor should they have gone ahead and published the story anyways. They should have simply *backed off* from this story  and found another one where the facts were all verified. Without a name of the accused rapist  Rolling Stone always ran the risk of finding one of those mentally ill women who lie for sympathy and attention. They should have known this was a possibility  and they failed to prevent it. 

In fact  the reporter had been trying to find a good college sexual assault case for a while (like a journalistic vulture) and hadn't found any that were ""good enough"" (wow that's horrifying to say) to be published. So we can see that the problem was not with feminism or the way that feminism tells us we should treat alleged rape survivors  but with the way Rolling Stone clearly sought the most sensational story they could find. And boy did they find it. A fraternity gang rape? Incompetent school administrators (speaking of which  for those who think this controversy was the establishment striking out against white males  two female school administrators were lambasted in the original article)? No justice for the victim? They had struck gold which turned out to be pyrite  and they missed all the warning signs which should have led them to simply not publish the story. They were right in a way  because their story got huge attention and more clicks than any other article on the website that isn't about a celebrity (per the damning report published yesterday).

What feminism says about how to treat alleged victims of sexual assault is 100% correct. You should treat them with full welcoming trust  at least until a real allegation is made. There is no concrete reason to do otherwise  because believing a lying woman has no real harmful consequences for anyone  while disbelieving a real victim of rape has a lot of harmful consequences. The failure here was not in this standard  but in Rolling Stone's standard of journalistic integrity. They betrayed their readers by ignoring warning signs in the pursuit of a sensationalistic story  and by framing their article in a way that made it seem like they had done more research than they really had. We know that media sensationalism has poisoned so many other media sources. I don't see why Rolling Stone is exempt from this phenomenon  and why feminism must be to blame instead. Talk about blaming the victim!

***Related to the above  I want to touch on the argument some Redditors made that this kind of false reporting will only stop if false rape accusers get as much jail time as rapists. I think this is just an awful idea. Most if not all women who falsely accuse someone are mentally ill. The way that Jackie describes her attack in such vivid memorable detail tells me that she is very likely mentally ill. Normal people don't weave complicated stories about their personal victimhood. Throwing her in prison would not be justice. Reddit would normally agree that a mentally ill person would not belong in prison (check out any Reddit post on people who are addicted to drugs  and whether they should be in prison or rehab - a valid point)  but when it comes to a lying woman the vitriol comes through.

CMV: taxpayers and the general public should never contribute money in financing new sports stadiums - that should be 100% on the owner.,"It's no secret - owners of sports teams are usually ultra wealthy  sometimes with billions in net worth. With many local economies struggling and the poor in dire need of resources  cities and states are spending hundreds of millions helping rich owners build stadiums.

For example  Cobb county in Georgia cut off funding for local parks so it could contribute to a new stadium for the Atlanta Braves. I understand that sports teams and stadiums provide economic benefits (jobs  local shops/bars  other sales  etc.)  but studies repeatedly show that the economic benefits rarely make up for these huge expenditures on stadiums.

It's a fiscally irresponsible use of limited local and state funds. If the government stops contributing to sports stadium financing  owners will still build these stadiums  and cities/states will free up hundreds of millions in tax revenue to spend where it is truly needed.

"CMV: The biggest problem with American politics is viewing people that we disagree with as ""the enemy"".","It appears to me that we've gotten to a point where liberals and conservatives hate each other with such passion  that those who disagree with us are seen as the enemy. The Internet  for all of the great it has brought us  has led our society to a state of hyper-polarization. Users can now consume only information that comports with their worldview  and thus  the hatred towards the ""other side"" has grown exponentially. This has led friends  neighbors  family members  and worst of all  Congress  to view those who disagree with them as evil. This has many ramifications in our political discourse  such as a constant state of gridlock.

I can not think of a single issue which prevents our society from moving forward as much as the pervasive attitude that those who disagree with us are ""the enemy"".

"CMV: Just like sex education, religion should be introduced to children only after they have reached a certain age and level of maturity.","Let me be clear. I know this cannot be imposed in any form by a government or a law. I am proposing this simply as a guideline for current and future parents. 

My arguments are as follows:

* Children in their early formative years are incapable of rational  informed thought. Their entire universe is structured around what their parents tell them. If you tell them that the Earth is the shape of an upside down ice-cream cone and the sun is at the tip of it  they will believe you. Not just believe you  this will become their truth. 


* As an adult  your religious beliefs directly influence the life you lead . It will influence the decisions you make in terms of your life partner you choose  the company you keep  the vote you cast and the path you take in life. It should not affect these things in an ideal world  but we do not live in such an ideal world. 


* Considering the vast impact that your religious beliefs have  it seems very unfair to have one particular strict  unflinching dogma drilled into you during your formative years as a kid. Religion should be a choice just like your hobbies  your friends and your career.

* You may argue that many of us were raised this way  and we eventually ""grew out of it"" or changed our views once we reached maturity and broadened our horizons  but that is not a valid argument in my book. For every story of a person who has changed or given up religion  there is another story of someone who's upbringing was extremely strict or orthodox and it continues to define them as an adult  with our without their knowing consent. 

* This particular point may be directed to a very small sub-section of the parent population but I'm going to make it anyways. Some parents use religion as a crutch to assist them in raising their children. By this I mean that  God is the perfect  scary  all-powerful  metaphorical carrot & stick for your kids. Teach your kids not to steal  because it is the wrong thing to do. Not because God is watching. Teach your kids to help the poor because it is the right thing to do  not because it will help them get into Heaven. I don't want to tell parents how to raise their kids but I am drawing from my own personal upbringing.

The gist of my argument is this: Religion is a beautiful thing **if** understood and practiced as it is meant to be. If not  it can turn ugly and cause misery to oneself and others. Therefore  it should be introduced to children carefully and only once they are mature enough to grasp its meaning and purpose.",478,4,9,16,20,"[['variant](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/sec.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/atheist-united-church-minister-starting-new-secular-community-in-toronto/article33442894/%3fservice%3damp)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['https://www.openbible.info/topics/good_deeds_to_go_to_heaven'], [':d](http://i.imgur.com/ynosp6q.jpg)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/dreamtime),', '(http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-creation-traditions),', '(http://www.cs.williams.edu/~lindsey/myths/myths_16.html)'], ['http://fortune.com/2015/03/03/women-led-companies-perform-three-times-better-than-the-sp-500/'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/faith/story.php?id=51077'], ['(http://biologos.org/common-questions/scientific-evidence/fossil-record/),', '(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evidence_of_common_descent).', '(http://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_3.htm)']]",0,90,2,Yes
CMV: Single toilet restrooms in restaurants that lock should not be gendered,"Edit two: going back to work. Will check again later :)

Edit: this blew up! Taking a break. At a bar. Back on later. :) probably in 8 hours. Gotta sober up

Just about everywhere I go late at night  there is a line to use single toilet restrooms that lock for the ladies room. I totally understand that if it's a multi-person toilet area  let's make two restrooms. Why don't restaurants just have two restrooms that are first come first serve?

Guys are definitely quicker. Can't argue against that. Is this the only reason or is there something I'm missing?

I mean  if a girl needs help with her dress or whatever  nothing would stop her and her friend from using either restroom. This would speed up he amount of time it takes to wait in line by half. 

Why is it important to have both a male designated and a female designated single toilet with a lock restroom? I'm sure it has something to do with the law  but help me understand why it's necessary. 

Sorry if it seems like I'm repeating myself - there isn't a whole lot to say to make the 500 word requirement on this topic.

CMV: Transgender (specifically MtF) athletes have an unfair advantage in strength-based sports and should only be able to participate in their biological gender group.,"This is in response to the post that hit the front page recently which can be seen here: http://www.outsports.com/2017/3/20/14983388/transgender-weightlifting-laurel-hubbard-wins

Biologically speaking  the male gender is already predisposed to stronger traits and as a response the Olympic Committee split competitions into two groups so that both genders have an ""equal playing field"". But with more acceptance and social tolerance  along with more transgender people coming out  problems have arose and will continue to rise until this gets dealt with and  to me  it's unfair and should be given strict guidelines and have no gender fluidity in the eyes of competitors.

Thanks guys  CMV! :)

Edit: Keep it civil guys!

"CMV: A man who didn't asked to be victimized, should not have his past brought into the public spotlight","Dr. David Dao  an Asian doctor  was beaten and victimized on an United Airlines flight the other day. After such events took place  the New York Post took advantage of this situation to look through Dao's personal record and history.

The New York Post released this article: http://nypost.com/2017/04/11/doctor-dragged-off-flight-convicted-of-trading-drugs-for-sex/  stating that the doctor was previously convicted of trading drugs for sex. How is this mature? Why is this okay? This article should not be in the public's interest and the doctor was already treated wrongly  with videos of him being victimized all over the internet  why are we putting information out there that doesn't need to be? This is ridiculous. 

So  why should we allow these popular news networks to put information out there to further mess with this man? Clickbait has gone too far...

"CMV: We should be able to fire and even arrest politicians midterm, if they are caught telling blatant lies or acting against public interests. Losing votes in the next elections is not enough. Election promises should be binding.","Politics and politicians are really important. They decide what happens to our country and to the people in it. They change the laws that affect us all. 

So  it is mind-boggling how easily they can get away with it  if they misuse their position to benefit select few of their friends  or lie to get the position and then do something else entirely for the next years. 

The laws about incarcerating politicians vary by their country  but in many cases it seems like you need either treason or stealing money directly into your own pocket before you face any judiciary consequences. If they have other politician friends  it seems to be downright impossible  even if rest of the country and its citizens are on the streets protesting. 

I think it should be much easier to fire politicians midterm if they are caught misusing their position or they are caught from blatant lies and are doing opposite of what they say they do. 

With great power should come great responsibility. Not being re-elected is not punishment enough for acting against public interest or lying about your intentions to the people who vote you to the office. 

I've met politicians who've openly said that they wanna be single-term politicians and don't care about not being re-elected. Then they continue to work for laws that make corruption easier  or evading taxes a breeze  or harm many of the common people to benefit a few of their CEO friends  like selling public institutions to private enterprises  for seemingly no benefit except to privatize for privatization's sake. People hate it  they don't care. They'll retire in a few years from public and are hugely rewarded by their friends. 

The laws to arrest or incarcerate politicians are difficult to execute. Who makes the laws about arresting politicians? Politicians. Who decides how much corruption is too much corruption? Politicians. Who decides how much politicians get paid? Politicians. 

Many of these get their position by lying to the public. When elections come  they all promise this and that to everyone  even if their promises contradict one another. When they get to power  they can just say  well  I couldn't do it  that's that. And okay  if that really is the case. But promises one makes should be binding. You have to provide sufficient evidence to the public that you tried to the best of your abilities to pursue these goals. 

I am not saying all politicians are bad  but many are. If you are caught lying again and again  giving statements that are false again and again  you should be punished. Maybe first a public warning  then maybe expelling the politician for a short amount of time  and then firing him from the public office for the rest of the term. He can try again in the next elections. 

Some might say that these actions might deter even honest people from going into politics. Maybe so  but I think proper laws against politicians who use their position wrongly  or get there by lying to the public and giving false promises  and truly implementing these laws would be overall beneficiary to any country. 

EDIT: Thanks guys for your input. Made me consider my position. Too many replies to answer each one  but thank you.

"CMV: The military budget of the US is unnecessarily large, and the militaristic goals of the US can be achieved with less funding","It is my view that the US can achieve their militaristic goals with a significantly reduced military budget. According to [these numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures)  the amount spent by one country approaches half of the world's total military expenditures. When you consider the percentage of GDP spent on military  the US at 3.3% is fairly average in spending  but with the astronomical margin in GDP between the US and the rest of the world  US military spending is miles beyond any other country and the disparity seems unnecessary. 

Taken from their [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army) the purpose of the US Army is...

* Preserving the peace and security and providing for the defense of the United States  the Commonwealths and possessions and any areas occupied by the United States
* Supporting the national policies
* Implementing the national objectives
* Overcoming any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States 

Those goals can be achieved with substantially less military funding. CMV. 

edit: My view was changed largely by the fact that the purpose of the US military is far more broad and essential to the current geopolitical landscape than I understood. Also several comments regarding past innovations of the military and a breakdown of why the US military costs more than that of other countries received deltas.

CMV: Transgender people should disclose they are transgender before engaging in physically intimate acts with another person.,"I'm really struggling with this.  

So  to me it just seems wrong to not tell the person your actual sex before engaging in intimacy.  If I identify as a straight man  and you present yourself as a straight woman  but you were born a man  it seems very deceitful to not tell me that before we make out or have sex.  You are not respecting my sexual preferences and  more or less  ""tricking"" me into having sex with a biological male.  

But I'm having a lot of trouble analogizing this.  If I'm exclusively attracted to redheads  and I have sex with you because you have red hair  but I later find out you colored your hair and are actually brunette  that doesn't seem like a big deal.  I don't think you should be required to tell me you died your hair before we make out.  

If I'm attracted only to beautiful people and I find out you were ugly and had plastic surgery to make yourself beautiful  that doesn't seem like a big deal either.

But the transgender thing just feels different to me and I'm having trouble articulating exactly why.  Obviously  if the point of the sex is procreation it becomes a big deal  but if it's just for fun  how is it any different from not disclosing died hair or plastic surgery?  

I think it would be wrong not to disclose a sex change operation.  I think there is something fundamental about being gay/bi/straight and you are being deceitful by not disclosing your actual sex.

Change my view.

EDIT:  I gotta go.  I'll check back in tomorrow (or  if I have time  later tonight).

CMV: Safe spaces are unhealthy because college students need to stop hiding from views that upset them.,In the college environment we are supposed to be challenging old ideas and popular opinions. Safe spaces go against the logic of the scientific method because they leave no room for hypotheses that offend or discomfort people. This is the same line of thinking that led to people believing the Earth was flat and everything revolves around us. It is not only egocentric but flat out apprehensive to need a safe space to discuss and debate. How will students possibly transition into the real world if they cannot have a simple discussion without their opinion being challenged?

CMV: The 2 party system and the electoral college are destroying America.,"The 2 party system creates an us vs. them mentality that is destroying our country. Most people immediately see someone in the opposite political party and disregard their opinion. Furthermore  2 parties does not create enough to encompass everyone's beliefs. Many people agree with one party on some issues and the other party on other issues. However  the electoral college forces a 2 party system. It is near impossible for a 3rd party to gain enough traction to succeed. Therefore  I believe that we should abolish the electoral college and elect officials via a popular vote. An argument I hear against this is that candidates wont rally in smaller states  but this is not a problem thanks to the age of technology we live in. Smaller states can get an understanding of and form an opinon on a candidate without ever seeing them in person  via the internet and television. I also think we should abolish all parties and elect people purely based on their opinions. This will create more options for the public and a more informed public. Instead of having to choose the lesser of 2 evils  people can actually vote for someone they believe in. In conclusion  the electoral college and the 2 party system are horrible for the general public and should be abolished.

"CMV: Today's FBI press conference shows without question that Hillary Clinton is above the law and is not being held to the same standards as less connected, powerful and rich Americans would be.","Today's FBI press conference explicitly states (among other things) that Hillary Clinton would not be charged with a criminal offence because she was not aware she was breaking the law. Awareness of the law is not generally required to convict someone from a crime and the only reason she has gotten away with it is because she is too powerful and well connected for members of law enforcement to risk their careers going after her. On top of this  her position in government would have explicitly made her aware of the seriousness of these offences and the consequences of not respecting the sensitive nature of the information she had access to. Finally  a lesser employee who committed these acts would be fired and never work in government again for such obvious mishandling of this information. Therefore  it is my opinion that Hilary Clinton has very clearly today been shown to be not subject to the same regulations as a less well connected  powerful and rich american and by extension the citizens of america do not live in a nation where rule of law can be expected to protect the common man from government corruption.

"CMV: LGBT-only schools are not a step in the right direction; they will not help tackle discrimination, only create a sense of ""otherness""","A charity here in the UK called *LGBT Youth North West* believes that a state-run school for LGBTQ students is possible within three years  and that this is a positive thing for students who identify in anyway as being non-heterosexual. They are taking the Harvey Milk School in New York as a model.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/plans-drawn-up-for-britains-first-lesbian-and-gay-school-9981822.html

http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/if-the-price-of-saving-gay-children-from-bullying-is-to-ghettoise-them-then-so-be-it-9984396.html

I believe this will not be truly in the best interest for gay or lesbian students  for a variety of reasons. If I were gay  and growing up in a deeply homophobic environment as student under the age of 16  I can't see how this would be to my benefit.  

* Completely understandable with the desire to have a safe environment for gay students  but is this not actually yielding to homophobic attitudes? Instead of tackling bullying culture  gay students are effectively segregated from other students for a time  the bullies got what they wanted. And when the bullies grow up and enter the workforce  they are only likely to ever carry over their prejudices and discriminatory attitudes. They need to be told that this isn't acceptable  and people of different sexualities aren't ""others""  but their own peers as well. Even though enrolment is purely voluntarily and temporarily  we should be concentrating on integration rather than enforcing our social differences  and stamping out intolerance. 

* ~~The example given as justification for the school; the case of a 14 year-old girl from a Christian family  who killed herself over guilt of being attracted to women. Elizabeth Lowe was afraid of coming out to her parents and friends. It is not clear  how exactly if this school existed  would it made it any easier for her to ""come out"" to her family. If a gay student can't admit this part of their life to their parents  how can they be able to ask to be enrolled in that school?~~

**http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2tpl0x/cmv_lgbtonly_schools_are_not_a_step_in_the_right/co1enmk**

* I've known plenty of LGBTQ people  they aren't immune from having deeply homophobic attitudes themselves. It is a view also held by some gay people that ""bisexuality"" is simply ""indecisiveness""  that ""queer"" is a buzzword  and transsexuality isn't necessarily wholly accepted by all either. There are preconceptions and ideals as to how a ""gay man"" should act like  and expectations for lesbians from other lesbians as well (""lipstick lesbian""  ""dykes"" etc). If the objective was to ""take sexuality out of the classroom""  I can only see this as failing  because they can't ensure freedom from discrimination  even between themselves. 

Any mistakes or anything I am not clear on in my post  let me know! I will **bold** any edits. Thank you!

**Edit 2**: Cleared up some bad writing in my post. Thank you for your responses so far!

"CMV: The claim that a man is ""mansplaining"" is a convenient and sexist way for women to silence debate instead of addressing the man's arguments.","I'm willing to acknowledge that women and men are treated differently in professional and social contexts. I don't have any data on hand to back this up  but I wouldn't dispute that all else being equal  men are expected to be more assertive and may garner more attention when speaking up than women.

Despite this social phenomenon which probably exists  it is intellectually dishonest  lazy  and frankly insulting for women to disregard the opinions of men by playing the ""mansplaining"" card. 

Each individual  whether male or female  has their own personal experiences and knowledge that others do not have. If a man happens to know more than a woman about a given subject and shares his knowledge with her  is he suddenly doing something reprehensible? I certainly would not condemn a woman for explaining something to a man  so why should the reverse be problematic?

One might counter my argument by stating that ""mansplaining"" requires more than a man simply explaining something to a woman. Sure  I'd be willing to admit this. Per wikipedia: mansplaining means: ""to explain something to someone  characteristically by a man to woman  in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing.""

The problem with using this term is that whether or not a person is being condescending or patronizing is entirely subjective. A given woman might feel that a given man is condescending  even though he may be in good faith and with no intention of coming across that way. This man may not even explain things differently to women than he does to men.

Of course  some men do treat women with greater condescension than they do men. However  even when this is the case  it is sexist to use the term ""mansplaining"" to characterize his behaviour. The problem with this term is the chilling effect that could ensue. If men now risk being condemned for explaining things to women (whether or not they are doing so in a condescending manner)  these men will simply avoid explaining things to women altogether.

I think that sharing information and knowledge is something that should be fostered and valued. This certainly means that the opinions of women should be valued too. We should not attempt to silence and prevent men from sharing their insights with women. Instead  both men and women should encourage women to share their own insights and make greater efforts to value what women share when they speak.

In short  I think the term ""mansplaining"" is a juvenile way to compensate for social injustices by indiscriminately attacking all men without attempting to resolve the core of the issue. Ultimately  using this term needlessly provokes hostility and does nothing to encourage people to listen to women more. 

Edit: **The definition of mansplaining**: I see a lot of users claiming that mansplaining has one definition  namely that the man must be condescending with a woman who knows as much or more than the man about the subject matter in question. These users claim that this is the *correct* definition of the term and that the definition I have provided (a man being condescending or patronizing when explaining something to a woman) is an *incorrect* definition. I can't say that I agree with this distinction. I gather that the term mansplaining is relatively new slang (according to googletrends the term originated in February 2008). The term has since been frequently used in situations covered by both the ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" definitions. I submit that this usage is what informs the definition  since it is how the term is commonly understood. There is no reason to preclude one definition or the other.

At this point  I still feel that it's use in either context is sexist. Even if the term is *supposed* to apply only in the *correct* definition situations  using the term in those situations will only make its use in both *correct* and *incorrect* situations more widespread. The term is itself open to interpretation and sounds to any objective male or female listener like a reproach of male-to-female explanations perceived to be condescending.

CMV: Religious beliefs are essentially opinions and should not be given more weight than any other type of belief or opinion.,"In the US  there are various exceptions and accommodations for religious beliefs. For instance  Catholic hospitals do not have to directly provide birth control and can instead sign a waiver with the actual birth control being supplied by a third party.

The Trump Administration is currently considering granting additional protections  and there are many conservatives who support the position that religious business owners should not have to serve gay couples  for instance.

I see two objections to this  one practical and one more philosophical:

* If applied to other characteristics of individuals  such as race for example  we would immediately say that people do not have the ""religious freedom"" to deny service to black Americans on the basis of race. Such a view would be widely condemned as racist and hearkens back to the days of Jim Crow.
* Religious beliefs are simply beliefs  and in a pluralistic society it does not make sense to continually grant exceptions to laws based on one category of beliefs without granting exceptions based on all categories. If anyone  for any reason  could say ""I do not want to serve gay individuals at my restaurant""  that would be one thing. But the policies being discussed grant that right-of-denial based only on religious beliefs.

I find these ""religious freedom"" policies to be thinly-veiled attempts at discrimination  but I also realize many Americans genuinely disagree with me. I'm hoping you can change my view and convince me that religious beliefs are indeed worthy of types of protections that beliefs justified in others ways are not. 

EDIT: This was a really great discussion  thanks everyone. Great first experience with CMV. I partially changed my view  based on recognizing that religious beliefs belong to an institution in addition to a person  and that religion itself has been around for a long time and has some pretty stable qualities that we all recognize. I still would like religious and non-religious beliefs to be treated equally  but I get that in certain circumstances it can make sense to take a religious belief seriously while skepticism can exist about a similar non-religious belief.

CMV:People who aren't open to donate their own organs or another body part should not be given one when they need it themselves.,"Let's say that you are someone who does not want to donate or are never open to do a donation. I'm not just talking about kidneys or part of you liver  but also about stemcells  blood or other tissue. This way you are not improving someones life quality or chances to live. We have a shortage of organs and the list is growing for people waiting for a donation. According to [Donatelife](https://www.donatelife.net/statistics/) every 10 minutes someone is added to the transplant waiting list. Every day 22 people die and we have 118 000 people waiting for a donation. The numbers are big and we already have a certain ruling about who should get the organs. So I want to add another criterium for the priority selection. People who were not open to donate should not receive an organ when they need one. This ruling is only used when there is a shortage of organs (which is almost always). Ofcourse when there is enough for everybody then the people who aren't open to donate should receive their organs. But for now I don't think that hypocrits should be benefiting of a system that they are not open to join even when they know they can save lives.

I know there are some points where you can say that donating might not be possible for someone. Those people should be excluded. Also it is known that donating a kidney increases health problems. My point is that you don't have to donate a kidney to help someone. Everything can help. If we force people to help others in our society we will be able to help many many people. Think about the lives you can save. Think about the fact that one day your family member or your friends being able to survive due to people being open to donate. When we look at the recent bombings or attacks here in Europe we see many people donating blood. So many people are donating that there are too many donations which is maybe the best thing to have an excessive amount of. 

Donating should be also very important in this day and age. We are improving everyday in the medical science and we should be taking advantage of that. We have the capability to help many people but we aren't using it the way we should. If you want to see the impact one donation can have I recommend watching [this vox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7EglP5A2Hg). In the video you see that one donation is able to help multiple people. So when we look back at the transplant waiting list you see that we don't need 118 000 donations  but even less than that. 118 000 is a big number  but the amount of people who can donate makes this number look miniscule. 

So we know the statistics  the numbers and the reasons why donation is such an important thing. It might come over as forcing people to donate  but sometimes a little push does more good than harm. Sometimes you should force people into a corner and make them do certain things to improve our society.

CMV: A negative paternity test should exclude a man from paying child support and any money paid should be returned unless there was a legal adoption.,"There have been many cases I've read recently where men are forced to pay support  or jailed for not paying support to children proven not to be theirs. This is either because the woman put a man's name on the forms to receive assistance and he didn't get the notification and it's too late to fight it  or a man had a cheating wife and she had a child by her lover.

I believe this is wrong and should be ended. It is unjust to force someone to pay for a child that isn't theirs unless they were in the know to begin with and a legal adoption took place. To that end I believe a negative DNA test should be enough to end any child support obligation and that all paid funds should be returned by the fraudulent mother. As for monetary support of the child that would then be upon the mother to either support the child herself or take the biological father to court to enforce his responsibility.

This came up in a group conversation and I was told it was wrong and cruel to women but the other party could not elaborate on how or why. I'm looking for the other side of this coin.

"I believe the government should be allowed to view my e-mails, tap my phone calls, and view my web history for national security concerns. CMV","I have nothing to hide. I don't break the law  I don't write hate e-mails  I don't participate in any terrorist organizations and I certainly don't leak secret information to other countries/terrorists. The most the government will get out of reading my e-mails is that I went to see Now You See It last week and I'm excited the Blackhawks are kicking ass.

**Edit:**  Wow I had no idea this would blow up over the weekend. First of all  your President  the one that was elected by the majority of America (and from what I gather  most of you)  actually EXPANDED the surveillance program. In essence  you elected someone that furthered the program. Now before you start saying that it was started under Bush  which is true (and no I didn't vote for Bush either  I'm 3rd party all the way)  why did you then elect someone that would further the program you so oppose? Michael Hayden himself (who was a director in the NSA) has spoke to the many similarities between Bush and Obama relating to the NSA surveillance. Obama even went so far as to say that your privacy concerns were being addressed. In fact  it's also believed that several members of Congress KNEW about this as well. BTW  also people YOU elected. Now what can we do about this? Obviously vote them out of office if you are so concerned with your privacy. Will we? Most likely not. In fact  since 1964 the re-election of incumbent has been at 80% or above in every election for the House of Representatives. For the Sentate  the last time the re-election of incumbent's dropped below 79% was in 1986. (**Source:** http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php). So most likely  while you sit here and complain that nothing is being done about your privacy concerns  you are going to continually vote the same people back into office. 

The other thing I'd like to say is  what is up with all the hate?!? For those of you saying ""people like you make me sick"" and ""how dare you believe that this is ok"" I have something to say to you. So what? I'm entitled to my opinion the same way you are entitled to your opinions. I'm sure that are some beliefs that you hold that may not necessarily be common place. Would you want to be chastised and called names just because you have a differing view point than the majority?

"CMV: If guilt is an acceptable weapon in the war against smoking, it should be used in the war against obesity as well.","In a lot of countries it is legal to put distasteful pictures on cigarette boxes and commercials are shown featuring ex smokers who are suffering from distasteful diseases warning kids not to smoke.  One such commercial features a woman with a tracheo-oesophageal puncture(hole in neck) warning potential smokers that dating is hard in her condition. I beleive that the same route should be taken towards obesity. Junk food should come with a warning and a distasteful picture showing the effects of obesity. There should be commercials with obese or formerly obese people warning of how hard it is to date while obese. CMV

CMV: Terrorism in the US is not a big deal and Trump's ban will have no impact on it,"A lot of people have been bringing up that ""the countries on Trump's ban aren't the ones that have people who killed Americans in terrorist acts in the US."" Which is valid. But I'd go even further: America doesn't have a terrorism problem. There's around an average of [10 deaths](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf) from terrorism in the US per year. How low could we possibly get that in a country with more guns than people?

Even assuming a diffuse probability in Muslims having a certain chance to commit these acts (which again  is not the case)  that is a 10/[3.3 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States)=0.0003%  chance that any given Muslim will kill someone through terrorism. And if you stopped all Muslim immigration (which this ban is not even doing)  that would decrease your chance of death from terrorism by 0.0003%*[50 000](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/05/17/the-religious-affiliation-of-us-immigrants/)=15%. So around 1 more death from terrorism a year.

And this is ignoring the possible increase in terrorism from growing animosity  problems with relations between countries  the deaths of refugees that we donÕt help  etc.

EDIT: Not exactly the change I thought might happen  but it turns out that the ban might actually increase the risk of terrorism due to alienation. I said ""Trump's ban will have no impact on it"". It very well could have an impact. Just probably not the direction we'd like.

CMV: Replacing the word 'privilege' with the word 'disadvantage' and talking about hardships faced by those people would go farther in getting people involved in social advocacy.,"I'm part of a group that has many members. I'm a straight  white  middle-class  Catholic guy who is married and has kids. I'm pretty fiscally conservative and pretty socially liberal. I've never *intentionally* said or done anything to anyone that would be considered racist or sexist or homophobic but there have definitely been a few times in my life where something I said or did landed poorly and the impact was considered racist or sexist of homophobic. (Obviously in those rare circumstances  I always apologize.)

But because I've never had the *intent* of a racist or sexist or homophobe  I often find myself put off by being reminded of my privilege. *White* privilege  *straight* privilege  *male* privilege  now even [*hair* privilege](https://heatst.com/culture-wars/villanova-student-shaves-her-head-to-confront-hair-privilege/?mod=sm_tw_post) .

From just a general  humanistic perspective  telling someone they have a societal advantage for something that they didn't earn only serves to put people on the defensive. I know there are things that come easier to me because of my race  gender and sexual orientation (and full head of hair) but when those things are called out in the context of telling me what my responsibility is to greater humanity instead of being *asked* to do what I can to help  it just doesn't make me want to get involved. 

Look at something like GoFundMe. Have you ever seen a page there telling people that they have a responsibility to give $1 to help those less fortunate? No. They put out the story and they ask for help. If I was intentionally doing things to keep people down  I could see being told about my responsibility to stop. But since I'm coming from the perspective of the person who *doesn't* do things to intentionally keep people down  it's off-putting to be told what I *should* be doing or what I *need* to be doing.

If  instead  I was told about black *disadvantages* or gay *disadvantages* or female *disadvantages * I would be significantly more likely to really take in what was being told to me and much more likely to take up advocacy with those already fighting.

I know I absolutely have these privileges and I'm not trying to argue that I don't. I'm saying that if the most important thing is calling out the establishment and finding reasons to be angry  then by all means let's keep doing what we're doing. But if the goal is to actually create millions more allies in these spaces and actually begin to change public sentiment  flipping the language would go a long way.

Change My View.

**EDIT** I have to go to bed now. I responded to dozens of comments and I'm really enjoying the conversation. There are still more than 100 responses that I need to dive into and I will do that tomorrow (Friday). Thank you all for some seriously thought-provoking comments.

CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues,"Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues  such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism  are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.

Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments Ð practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race  gender  sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight  white  male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere  exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points  causes many to abandon the left.

Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals  given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons  but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.

"CMV I would rather vote for a third party candidate that is closer to my political standings rather than ""the lesser of two evils""","When I registered to vote at 18  I registered as a democrat without being fully aware of what the party platform was  and its recent history. I knew I agreed with democrats more than republicans  and decided I was a democrat. I'm 24 now  and have learned a lot since then. I have also realized since then that I am very far left of the Democratic party.

Democracy should be about having a voice for your opinions  and having a two party system keeps many people voting for what they would consider the lesser of two evils instead of voting for someone they actually agree with. I'm far left of the Democratic party  and think Hillary Clinton is doing a lot of things I find morally wrong. I have read through her website multiple times  and disagree with a lot of what she wants to do and why she wants to do it.

Donald Trump seems like he would be a horrible president  and is way too vague when it comes to what he wants to do. Even with the vagueness  I strongly disagree with his plans if he becomes the president. 

Democracy in the US has been a two party system for almost its entire history  and I think that's horrible. I'm far left of both parties and would rather vote my conscious with someone that has a political stance closer to mine. 


Most people's argument against this is ""but imagine TRUMP as president!!"" Yes  I agree that would not be a good thing  but I also feel that Hillary would not represent me or my beliefs. Although I would consider Hillary Clinton as the lesser of two evils (only by a little)  she is still far right of what I would want in my president.

**Edit: Thanks for all of the responses  this is a great community / subreddit. I'm trying my best to get to each comment  but you guys are posting a lot faster than I can read and reply  especially with all of the well thought out and detailed replies. Seriously though  thank you for the great conversations.**

Edit 2: To clarify something  I don't expect any third party candidate to win. Voting third party would just be a vote for someone I believe in  which is part of democracy.

Edit 3: Not too relevant in the overall discussion  but I saw a few comments saying that my views are center right. https://www.politicalcompass.org/yourpoliticalcompass?ec=-5.13&soc=-2.87

CMV: We need to change the way the world views pedophilia: in the sense that we need to view the problem as an illness rather than a purposeful crime.,"My basis on this argument is that pedophilia is as much an illness as your depression or other mental disorder.

A lot of people who are sexually attracted to children don't choose to be. It is simply how they feel and have zero control over it.

I have come over several people online who have had sexual attraction to underage kids and feel like monsters  they hate themselves for it and how they even could have thoughts like these. (This is however anecdotal  yet I feel like it sets the basis of my opinion.)

These people would never admit these feelings out of fear of being an outcast. Families and friends would avoid them  they would find it hard to get jobs and would be treated like monsters. If they felt it was safe to be honest about these feelings without the fear of becoming ostracised than maybe they would come forward more often to seek help.

If hidden and not dealt with  these emotions could result in using child pornography or even sexually abusing a child themselves.

The reason we classify things as mental disorders is because it does not fit our societal expectations or understandings.

It is the same reason that homosexuality was seen as abnormal and deemed as a mental illness and it wasn't that long ago that transgenderism was seen as another mental illness.

These people need to be seen as humans and helped before they do something they will regret.

I have been meaning to make this post for a while but felt it seemed fitting now with Kevin Spacey's allegations coming into light.

Could this all have been prevented if he got the necessary help in the first place? I don't know  but I would like to think it would be a step in the right direction.

End point: pedophilia is an illness and should be treated as such  not a purposeful desire to harm.

"CMV: Bitcoin's value is strictly backed by the idea that the next person will pay more for it (greater fool theory), not because it is a finite and decentralized currency.","Hello Reddit  as the title states I am a firm believer that bitcoin has no value other than the idea that the next person will pay more for it. I myself invested quite a lot into bitcoin and was successful in paying off all my student loans thanks to this  so I should be happy about bitcoin's popularity  but as I see more and more friends investing I am worried they don't fully grasp what they are getting into. I invested with the thought in mind that my investment had no actual value  but would increase because people would think it had value. However  other investors I speak to seem to invest because they think bitcoin itself has value  but I just don't see it. My worry is that this rumor based investing is getting out of hand and will eventually result in greater economic consequences when bitcoin crashes  taking the savings of the many ignorant investors down with it. 

Reasons I do not think it has value:

* not widely accepted enough to use in day to day transactions (arguable)

* fluctuation in value negates any use as currency 

* liquidation can take 2-3 weeks 

* Defined as currency  yet treated like an asset.

CMV: Net neutrality will never be truly & permanently protected until it is recognized as a basic civil liberty in the US.,With the FCC expected to repeal net neutrality  I began thinking about the incredible harm this could do  and what our options even are in the face of this decision. Was this somehow inevitable or could we have taken steps to prevent it? Once it is officially decided  will there be any way to reverse it? Even if we do reverse this attempt  what will stop them from trying this again in a few years? I came to the conclusion that the only way net neutrality will be entirely and permanently protected is if it is recognized as a basic civil liberty  and therefore is protected by the Constitution. This is a sad thought  however  because it seems very difficult and unlikely to get that kind of ruling (basically a constitutional amendment). Is there any other way? ,256,2,3,25,39,"[['http://www.ronpaullibertyreport.com/archives/ditch-net-neutrality-now'], ['cities](https://fiber.google.com/newcities/),'], ['isps](https://www.broadbandmap.gov/number-of-providers).', '1](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/us-broadband-still-no-isp-choice-for-many-especially-at-higher-speeds/).', '2](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/50-million-us-homes-have-only-one-25mbps-internet-provider-or-none-at-all/).'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkvn4x/the-21-laws-states-use-to-crush-broadband-competition', 'https://www.wired.com/2013/07/we-need-to-stop-focusing-on-just-cable-companies-and-blame-local-government-for-dismal-broadband-competition/'], ['http://www.pnhp.org/news/2016/january/government-funds-nearly-two-thirds-of-us-health-care-costs-american-journal-of-pub'], ['1.comcast'], ['too](http://www.itscosts.its.dot.gov/its/benecost.nsf/displayrucbyunitcostelementunadjusted?readform&unitcostelement=fiber+optic+cable+installation+&subsystem=roadside+telecommunications+).'], [""1](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/50-million-us-homes-have-only-one-25mbps-internet-provider-or-none-at-all/)'s"", 'competition](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/broadband-access.png)', ""2](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/us-broadband-still-no-isp-choice-for-many-especially-at-higher-speeds/)'s"", '2015](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fcc-figure-5.jpeg)'], ['[here](http://transition.fcc.gov/daily_releases/daily_business/2017/db1122/doc-347927a1.pdf)'], ['1.comcast'], ['https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/att-and-comcast-win-lawsuit-they-filed-to-stall-google-fiber-in-nashville/'], ['https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/09/att-sues-nashville-in-bid-to-stall-google-fiber/'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['http://www.esa.doc.gov/under-secretary-blog/how-much-competition-exists-among-isps'], ['https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8530403/chattanooga-comcast-fcc-high-speed-internet-gigabit'], ['>https://consumerist.com/2014/05/10/why-starting-a-competitor-to-comcast-is-basically-impossible/'], ['cases](https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history)', '(http://fortune.com/2014/06/23/telecom-companies-count-386-billion-in-lost-revenue-to-skype-whatsapp-others/).'], ['(https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionseg2.php?code=cmcsa)', 'https://xkcd.com/1138/)'], ['http://www.esa.doc.gov/under-secretary-blog/how-much-competition-exists-among-isps'], ['https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/us-broadband-still-no-isp-choice-for-many-especially-at-higher-speeds/'], ['http://www.esa.doc.gov/under-secretary-blog/how-much-competition-exists-among-isps'], ['graph](https://imgur.com/a/pqwbq)', 'study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327f513959d0a304d4893b382b992b)'], ['[image](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heatmap.png)', '[mobile](https://m.xkcd.com/1138)', '[explaination](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1138)', '[xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com)', '[problems/suggestions](https://github.com/benreid24/xkcd_bot/issues)', 'stats!](http://xkcdredditstats.com)']]",0,80,1,Yes
CMV: I support Donald Trump,"In light of the recent massive online outcry against Trump  I want to once more reflect on the validity of my views. During the election cycle  I came to respect Trump even if I could see his flaws. The arguments I saw for him/his positions were generally logical and well reasoned  while the arguments against him were ad hominems  personal stories  and otherwise emotional in nature. Any time I questioned things  I was called a racist and a bigot. Even though for most of my life I considered my views liberal  the election cycled saw me switching to the Trump Train.

Specifically on the recent immigration issue  while I don't think it will particularly stop terrorism or that terrorism is a threat currently  I do think it shows Trump's commitment to preventing a situation like the one in Europe. The initial green card situation was unfortunate  but from what I have seen was quickly solved. In addition  I see no reason why non-citizens  regardless of what they've gone through  should feel entitled to enter the US. Yes  it would be nice to help people  but realistically the world is filled with people who are suffering  even in our own country  and we should be smart with who and how we help. 

I hold a similar view on something like the wall. I don't think it will even close to eliminate illegal immigration  and it won't even stop the main source of illegal immigration. However  it will stop some illegal immigration  and from what I've seen the cost is relatively minimal.

In terms of bringing jobs back  I think its a simple concept that if things can be done cheaper outside the US without any downside  they will be done elsewhere. I don't know how successful Trump will be  but I believe free trade deals will only hurt the average american worker. 

As for diplomacy  given the US's economic and military power  I don't see how Trump can hurt US relations. Dictators and horrible regimes across the globe are worked with because of the resources they have  and from a purely statistical standpoint I don't think the US can be ignored. I have no doubts some in the international community will hate Trump  but others will like him  and regardless the US has enough leverage that they will be worked with. I also don't believe Trump will start any major wars. He is highly successful and even his greatest detractors admit he cares about himself  so especially after he has stated he is anti-war  I do not see him getting into a situation where he puts himself at risk.

Finally  in terms of his provocative actions/statements  I generally don't have an issue with him. I am a quite un-PC person  and on top of that I have seen many of his actions/statements twisted brutally out of proportion. I think he has a blustery personality and has a habit of talking with his foot in his mouth  but I have yet to see something that makes me truly believe he is a cruel or vindictive person.  

If there are any specific questions or if somebody wants me to provide more information on a point  I will do so. I hope that a civic discussion can be maintained.

CMV: I feel like non-binary genders are just a ploy for attention and are actually disrepectful towards trans men/women,"I believe that gender is a product of socialization  and therefore you cannot be of a gender that isn't recognized by society.


I get trans women/men  because they essentially are assigned to one out of the two recognized genders (male/female) but identifiy themselves and want to be socially recognized as the opposite.


Non-binary genders aren't really a part of society. There are no gender roles for a ""demi-boy"" or a ""agender"" person. It makes no sense that someone wants to be recognized in one of these categories because these categories essentially don't exist to society.


How is it not just a term for saying that you **act** outside the gender norms that wew assigned to you? How can one **identify** with these genders if there is no such thing as a social product? And if it is indeed just about behaviour/ how is this not offensive towards trans people? How is this not trivializing gender identity??



EDIT: about the ""ploy for attention"" thing  I'm truly sorry if I offended anyone. As /u/_mach pointed out  this is likely confirmation bias of my part because most of the exposure I've had to non-binary people was on the crazy realms of the internet/tumblr. The fact that some people are doing this for attention shouldn't mean that everyone is. 



EDIT2: I think i geniunely have a better understanding about this now. I don't doub there people exist or that their experiences are valid. I guess I'm still having some trouble with concepts  as I explained in a lot of my coments in this thread. It's not as much as I can't believe a non-binary experience is real/valid  but that I can't really understand how it's more than just a gender performance/expression and actually constitutes a new identy. Most of the comments were super helpful though at broadening my understanding of the topic.

"CMV: Win or lose, Donald Trump has drastically altered American political culture for the worse, and opened the door to all kinds of batshit insanity in the future","Let me just say now that this is not a thread to discuss whether or Donald Trump ought to be president; my view is that he's a national embarrassment  the worst mainstream presidential candidate in US history  and utterly unqualified to hold any public office  and I'm not likely to change that view any time soon. What I want to discuss is the extremely unusual and alarming nature of this election cycle  and what it means for the future of America and the world.

The tl;dr is this: **Donald Trump has essentially changed the rules of American political culture in such a way that he's completely erased any standards of decency  honesty or credibility from the electoral process.** Things that would have ended political careers before this election cycle have now become so normal with Trump that no one even cares. And that bodes very  very poorly for the future.

While [this](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/things-donald-trump-has-said-and-done-that-in-a-normal-election-would-disqualify-a-nominee/) source is obviously biased  it aggregates  using external sources  the evidence for the point I'm making  and which we all understand already: Donald Trump has said and done a lot of insane  deplorable shit and somehow still has a very real shot at becoming president. What the hell is going on here? Remember just four years ago  when Mitt Romney's ""takers"" blunder nearly sank his campaign  and almost certainly contributed to his defeat at the polls? Remember when a single gaffe like that was nearly fatal to a presidential candidate? What the fuck has happened over the past four years? And what's going to happen in the future? As we near the debates  which are all but guaranteed to be a shitshow unlike anything we've seen before  I can't help but wonder.

Even if Trump loses  I worry about the next lunatic  and the next one. Trump has paved the way for more candidates as bad or worse than him  and if he can come this close to winning now  it seems to me like it's only a matter of time before someone of his ilk gets elected. Thanks to Trump  and his supporters  we've entered a bizarre alternate dimension where candidates can lie about basically anything  and no matter how fucking crazy or bigoted they get  it means nothing at all to their supporters. Feelings have completely ""trumped"" facts and logic for a huge portion of the voting demographic. This anti-intellectual undercurrent has been strong in American politics since forever  but I never thought it could get this bad. Nor did many others. We were wrong. And now I'm legitimately worried about the future.

**EDIT: This is not a thread about Hillary Clinton either; she is dishonest but in no way remarkable in that regard. She's far more qualified  and certainly doesn't lie as shamelessly as Trump  or pander to xenophobia nearly as much. This is part of my view that you're not going to change. So if you're going to try to derail the thread  kindly move along.**

**EDIT EDIT: For those disappointed that I awarded a delta  the rules say to award one if someone changes your view ""in some way."" The poster in question did convince me that I may be overstating the problem  and that the future may not be as dim as I made it out to be. But I nevertheless still hold the concerns outlined in the OP.**",483,2,3,30,60,"[['strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_8e3enrkrq)'],

"CMV: In a capitalist country where competitiveness and meritocracy are really priced, education must be free, or at least esaily accesible for everyone.","I'm ideologically centre  at least in my country (I suppose I would look like a fucking commie in the states)  and support some socialist policies I find necessary for the correct functioning of a country  even a capitalist one. While I understand  even if I don't share  the arguments against a lot of these policies  like universal  public healthcare  publicly founded science and investigation  or pensions  I can't understand why some people argue against public education from basic school to university. 

In my opinion  for there to be real competition  everyone must have the same starting posibilities  and this is not true if your lack of access to wealth as a child limits your ability to get formed  as you completely depend from your parents. This does not mean that there shouldnt be private schools  after all  if someone can afford them  let 'em  just that everyone should have a right to quality education. 

This continues with universities  where  in a system without public universties  or at least without actually cheap ones  if you dont want to get into very severe debt  you must choose marginally worse universties  which all leads to worse jobs  less options for your children  and the eternal circle will continue.

So  what are some arguments against easily available  cheap and quality public education?

"CMV: There is a very serious problem with ""black culture"" in America that nobody is willing to call out or speak honestly about, and this needs to change ASAP","**EDIT:** ""Slum culture"" or ""ghetto culture"" have been suggested as alternative names for this problem. In any case  what we call it is not really what I'm interested in discussing.

_____

This post was mostly inspired by this video  [Exhibit 1](https://www.facebook.com/ModCn/videos/864799580335172/)  that one of my extremely conservative friends shared on Facebook.

Facebook has censored the video  but there's no blood  gore  or otherwise graphic content. The video shows an innocent young-ish woman and her son being hunted down and savagely beaten by a black girl  while a crowd of other black teens watches  films  and encourages her.

**NOTE:** I don't follow the page that originally posted it and have no interest in discussing other things this page has posted  as they're totally irrelevant.

___

This isn't an isolated kind of thing. If you look hard enough  you can find videos just like this all over the internet.

 - [Exhibit 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djx3T9IEc1A). An elderly man is beaten in the street by a gang of black teenagers  allegedly for voting Trump.

 - [Exhibit 3](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4095726/Victim-Chicago-race-torture-asking-friend-idolized-black-gang-charged-beating-burning-chanting-f-Trump-f-white-people.html). We all remember the case where 4 black kids tortured a mentally disabled kid for hours and streamed the entire incident.

 - [Exhibit 4](http://www.cleveland19.com/story/32814897/men-chant-black-lives-matter-before-viciously-attacking-white-victims). A gang of 5 ambush and assault 7 men.

 - [Exhibit 5](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/03/15/gang-of-thugs-brutally-beat-up-man-after-he-offers-to-help-pay-for-their-meal/). Two young black men begin a beat-down of a middle-aged man for the offense of offering to help pay for their meal  later joined by three others.

 - [Exhibits 6-176](http://whitegirlbleedalot.com/top-100-black-mob-violence-videos/). An extensive compendium. I haven't personally watched every single one  and don't have the time to.

_____

Most critically  **as I see it this is not a race issue.** It's an issue of a culture that exists predominantly in low-income black-majority areas  but it's not unique to black people nor does it affect all of them. You'll notice that two of the perpetrators in exhibit 4 are white  along with possibly others in exhibits 6-176.

Poverty in these areas is certainly an exacerbating factor  but I don't believe it is the sole cause. Poverty-driven crime is that in which the criminal is trying to gain something; selling drugs  theft  etc. This crime is simply belligerent. The perpetrators are gaining nothing from it aside from satisfaction. Moreover  I have personally witnessed this ""thug life"" culture in extremely affluent areas  being adopted by the children of very well-off families (though again  not all or even most of them).

_____

As I said  this is a problem of culture. Portions of it may be due to anti-intellectualism  neglect of family  general lack of care for others  lack of ambition or motivation to improve one's life  lack of respect for the law  lack of self-restraint  or more. I'm not even going to try to explain the depth of it  because I don't know it. Nor do I know how it could could even begin to be repaired. And I realize that the culture is neither exclusive nor universal to black people  but I can't think of a better term for this culture. It seems to go beyond just ""thug life.""

But right now **nobody will even talk about this ** because to do so will instantly have you be branded a racist. I fully expect an inbox full of replies and messages calling me a nazi  a racist  a white supremacist  and more (which is why I'm using a throwaway account). I assure you I'm none of the above  though of course that won't convince you.

**Clarification:** ""Nobody"" means nobody in mainstream news and discussion circles. Obviously there are small corners of the internet (including this one) where this does get discussed  but not in any impactful way.

There is a critical failure in this culture that contributes heavily to the continued poverty and misery of these areas. If we keep dancing around it in the interest of race sensitivity  it will never be fixed and people will continue to suffer.

CMV: I think it is shameful that every modern nation has national vacation polices except for America.,"I think that it is shameful that Americans donÕt get more time off from work. It seems that most of our lives revolve meaningless work  at times  just for the sake of work. I think it would be more appropriate to value your workers more and emulate countries like Italy  France  and New Zealand whom provide mandatory time of for its citizens. 
I have a co-worker who just had a kid and canÕt afford to be home with her. My companyÕs PTO policy is 2 weeks per fiscal year  and she has met this from being sick. This has caused a lot of people around the office to fall ill and use their PTO time for sickness. I know this isnÕt very relevant to vacation  but still  it is like we are work martyrs.  Personally  I feel that free time leads to reflection and growth. This contributes to an overall better sense of well-being and happiness  and I donÕt think we are doing much to encourage that in our society. 40+ hours a week  50+ weeks a year for 40+ years just doesnÕt seem fair. 
I think we should provide our citizens with a base-line of minimum time off from work. I think that this will be great for several aliments of our society. Think about it? How many of us truly like work? It is an necessary evil. Roughly 70% of Americans are unsatisfied with their work and we spend most of our time goes there. I am open to fair debate and education on this topic. Thanks  Reddit!

CMV: Libertarians should be as concerned about super rich individuals and Big Corporations as they are about Big Government,"Libertarians are rightfully concerned about Big Government. Big Governments invariably tend to abuse their power. However  the main reason why big governments get abusive is because of the disproportional accumulation of power. And humans absolutely suck at retaining their values and ethics when they get extraordinary levels of power. As such  I find big governments no different at all from megarich individuals or mega corporations. In modern times  they are the ones who actually run the government. They use lobbying and funding to control and push their agendas  to pass highly unethical laws that consolidate and promote their own self interests. They own the politicians.

I only have a basic level understanding of libertarianism but my interpretation of the core philosophy is about ""live and let live"". Give people full autonomy but equally importantly  they should not infringe on your autonomy. Your hand stops at my nose  figuratively speaking.

The big problem is  when megarich individuals as well as megacorporations are left unsupervised  they wield such extraordinary levels of power  that they are literally above the system  above any level of accountability. I feel that libertarians should be as concerned about them as they are about Big Government.

I totally realize and acknowledge the dilemma I am presenting here. However on a practical basis  what I see is more of the abuse of extraordinary power than anything. And it is scary. Hence my view as it stands. Would love to hear your opinion!

CMV: Obese/Morbidly obese people should have to purchase a second plane ticket when they cannot physically fit in their allocated seat.,I've been flying quite a lot recently and have noted that 70% of the time I am seated next to someone who would be considered obese  or even morbidly obese (I live in a country that is in the top 5 for rates of obesity). Now  I am quite a small person so I obviously don't understand the struggles these people face. However I do value personal space (and especially on longer flights). This has lead me to the unfortunate opinion that these people should be required to purchase a second ticket  mostly on smaller aircraft  to accomodate to their needs. I don't like this opinion I have  but I can't help but think this when I'm sitting next to a complete stranger and they're taking up half of my seat  as well as theirs. ,481,1,1,32,38,"[['https://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/extra-seat/?clk=gfooter-customer-cos'], ['https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/29/incredible-shrinking-airline-seat-us-court-says-seat-size-a-safety-issue'], ['man](https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/an-overweight-man-bought-two-plane-tickets-for-himself-then-he-says-the-airline-.html)'], ['shrinking](http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2017/07/31/incredible-shrinking-airline-seat-forces-faa-to-reconsider-regulating-seat-size.html).'], ['decreased](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/how-airline-ticket-prices-fell-50-in-30-years-and-why-nobody-noticed/273506/)'], ['http://gawker.com/5471463/update-the-kevin-smith-southwest-airlines-fat-flight-tweakout-of-epic-proportion'], ['smith](http://people.com/celebrity/kevin-smith-too-fat-to-fly-southwest/)?'], ['inches.](https://www.today.com/style/what-s-average-size-16-new-normal-us-women-t103315)', 'inches.](http://www.npr.org/2014/07/25/332641840/the-average-american-man-is-too-big-for-his-britches)'], ['article](http://www.firstinarchitecture.co.uk/average-male-and-female-dimensions/)'], ['[story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/07/05/united-accidentally-gave-a-toddlers-seat-away-and-made-his-mom-hold-him-for-a-3-hour-flight/)'], ['https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/mcgee/2014/09/24/airplane-reclining-seat-pitch-width/16105491/', 'http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-01/business/chi-jetmakers-feud-over-airline-seat-widths-20131101_1_airbus-john-leahy-plane-giants'], ['staggering.](http://www.livestrong.com/article/384722-how-much-have-obesity-rates-risen-since-1950/).', '[5\'9""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_average_human_height_worldwide)', '[194lbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_body_weight).'], ['https://www.cheapair.com/blog/travel-tips/airline-policies-for-overweight-passengers-traveling-this-summer/'], ['ass](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f4/52/55/f4525508292784e404900ab7690ec1a8.jpg),'], ['[actually...](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/samoa-air-pay-what-you-weigh)'], ['http://www.huffingtonpost.com/smartertravel/worst-legroom-airlines_b_2482315.html'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetics_of_obesity).', 'study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3545283/)'], ['$5](http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20161020-should-obese-passengers-pay-more).'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['https://www.regulations.gov/document?d=faa-2015-4011-0001'], ['https://worldairlinenews.com/2014/04/07/boeing-opens-737-interior-configuration-studio/'], ['([source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/mcgee/2014/09/24/airplane-reclining-seat-pitch-width/16105491/)).'], ['http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199005243222102#t=article', '2016](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/health/americans-obesity-willpower-genetics-study.html)'], ['fitsÓ](http://blog.luggagebase.com/files/2014/03/delta-air-lines-carry-on-size-check-box-old-sizewise-22-14-9.jpg)'], ['https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/02/26/still-struggling-u-s-obesity-rates-stalled-over-the-last-10-years/#2e5a786f6e16'], ['http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/'], ['ago](http://fortune.com/2015/09/12/airline-seats-shrink/),'], ['ago](http://fortune.com/2015/09/12/airline-seats-shrink/),'], ['http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2008.284/full'], ['lbs](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/06/weight.png&w=480)']]",1,192,1,Yes
"CMV: America has been groomed to give Service Members too much ""respect""","First off  I am a Soldier with 10 years of service and a veteran of OEF. I know just about every soldier feels uncomfortable hearing ""thank you for your service""  because we mostly feel like ""thank you"" is not necessary. With that being said... American citizens give us too much credit. 

Our country has been at war longer than it ever has been before. Themes of ""support our troops"" have been engrained in citizens for so long  many have begun to put soldiers in a superior position. And it is dangerous. 

Our opinions are no better than any other citizens... I am no better than any other citizen. The tactic of using soldiers as a political football is wrong and disturbing. A recent example of this is the twisting of a peaceful protest against discrimination by police  kneeling during the National Anthem  into disrespect to soldiers. It's important to remember the flag represents every American...NOT JUST SERVICE MEMBERS. These ideas will lead to nationalist thoughts and ideas. 

It's unfortunate. If anyone challenges a service members political opinion  especially on a public forum like social media  they risk being crucified.

Our opinions are not any better  and are often based on passion over logic. Passion that comes from years of giving our all. But that passion can make us not see clearly. 

Citizens as well as current and former service members need to speak out against giving service members blanket support because of their service. We need to really challenge ideas from all sides and apply clear logic and critical thinking when we form opinions.",331,1,1,15,19,"[['www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/watch.'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonus_army'], ['video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdqpldm6c0w).'], ['exactly.](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2000/05/drooling_on_the_vietnam_vets.html)'], ['vietnam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_spitting_image)'], ['[definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_anthem)'], ['1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_party_presidential_primaries,_1996#background)', '[later](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/21/colin-powell-places-third-presidential-race-electo/)', 'veterans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swift_vets_and_pows_for_truth)', '[serviceman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_life_and_military_career_of_john_mccain)', '[seniority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_presidents_of_the_united_states_by_military_service)'], ['http://media.giphy.com/media/bg4pmh02w4tx6/giphy.gif'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_enduring_freedom)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straussÐhowe_generational_theory'], ['https://huwieler.net/2017/01/18/chelsea-manning-in-basic-combat-training/'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wesley_clark_presidential_campaign,_2004'], ['[myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_spitting_image)']]",0,85,1,Yes
CMV: America is not exceptional bastion of freedom anymore,"A comedian once said something along the lines: I don't get why everyone here is so excited and proud about American freedom. Like yeah  we got freedom. But so does almost everybody else. America is free  sure. So is UK. Canada is free. France is free. Germany is free. Australia and New Zealand are free. Norway  Denmark  Sweden  Italy  Spain are free. Japan is free. Belgium is free. So get over it. 

EDIT: This was the clip I was thinking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q49NOyJ8fNA

I agree with him. I understand that in 18th and 19th century USA was exceptional compared to the rest of the world. I understand the historical perspective. But that is not case anymore  has not been in a long while  but still  to this day  Americans spout their freedom-liturgy in news and politics to the annoyance of the rest of the world. I feel like many Americans still believe in that their country is exceptional is some freedom-index  and therefore superior  but I disagree. 

What freedoms Americans have that rest of the developed world does not? Speech? Nope. Religion? No-no. I can only think of that your laws about carrying guns are more lenient than elsewhere. But many countries have freedoms Americans do not. 

An example: Freedom of movement in nature. In Nordic countries (where I am from) everyone can go to ~~public~~ forests and hang around there  making camp  picking up berries and mushrooms or firewood  and as long as you do not disturb others or nature  it is your right to be there. As I am aware  this is not a thing in USA  but very much a basic freedom here in Nordic countries. If there is a forest or a hill  you are allowed to go there and stay. No one will threaten to shoot you for doing so. 

Another example: Political freedom. USA is a two-party system. You can vote for other parties too  but in reality your political leaders and lawmakers always come from either party. You either vote one of them  or whoever you voted is not elected. Many other countries are not two-party systems. If either/none of the current parties appease you or fit your agenda  you can vote for a third (or fourth  or fifth  or sixth) party and chances are they can become big enough to get into the government. There are many recent examples of this  former fringe-parties gaining popularity with changing times and gaining responsibility for the country too. In USA this is only theoretical possibility. Like in some former communist countries  where you could vote  but if you did not vote the party favored candidate  you vote did not actually matter and your candidate did not get elected. 

One more example: Freedom to use drugs recreationally. Netherlands (where my brother-in-law is from) is the classic example. You want to smoke weed without getting arrested? Go ahead  in Netherlands there are many places you can do so. In USA prisons are full of drug-users. 

Also the big thing is the American dream. But American dream has not been true or exceptional for many  many years. It is less true in America than many other places  as USA's social mobility is in fact  low. If you are American you are less likely to change your social position by hard work  than in many other developed countries. Not more likely  less. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#/media/File:Social_mobility_is_lower_in_more_unequal_countries.jpg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#/media/File:Intergenerational_mobility_graph-1.jpg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_mobility_in_the_United_States#/media/File:The_Great_Gatsby_Curve.png

So  you know  America is fine. Good on freedoms  not bad on social mobility. Before you guys were exemplary  now the rest of the world has caught up. So  can we please tone down the rhetoric a bit? CMV! 

EDIT: So far the best arguments have been about freedom of speech. Consider my view at least partly changed.

"CMV: If an ISP sells your data, you deserve a cut of the profit.","My position is quite simple. My browser history is mine. I made it. If an ISP is going to sell it  then I deserve a portion of the proceeds.

I've had similar debates before and one thing that comes up is: it would only be fractions of a penny. When an ISP sells personal data they don't sell it person by person. They consolidate their data into blocks of hundreds of thousands of individuals and sell that. The data of one person isn't worth much at all (depends on the person I guess) but the data of one of these blocks is. So for me to claw out the value of just my data  may only be pennies and my cut of those pennies might not even be half. 

However  I dislike the idea that I am just suppose to accept that someone else gets to sell the product of my work. It's like someone trying to sell the dust from your footsteps. If they're going to do it  I deserve a share of the money. I'm the one doing all the walking. 

**EDIT**

I can be very stubborn. I wouldn't be here on the internet bitching about pennies if I were not a silly  bitter person. While my mind has not been changed  all the people participating have valid persuasive criticisms. In responding  many required me to think and re-think my position. 

To just stop being an old man yelling at clouds is also compelling. 

Thank you for the discussion.

"CMV: Calling out Black Americans for ""Acting White"" is Racist","Based on a recent CMV I made  a lot of people seem to suggest that it's acceptable to call a black American who speaks ""white"" English ""acting white"" or ""kow-towing"" to white culture.

Similarly  I have also read articles and seen media interviews where a black conservative would be criticized for being an ""Uncle Tom"" for not supporting liberal policies.

To me  this type of behavior is outrageous; it presumes that all black people must conform to a certain type of ""black behavior""  or else they are betraying their race or culture. However  it seems to me that polite society tolerates this type of aggression against black people  especially when it comes from other black people.

Am I missing something? Why is this type of behavior not racism that should be universally condemned?  Why is it being tolerated and even perpetuated by people who are supposedly against racism?

CMV: it's hypocritical to simultaneously believe that 1) people should have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps if they're unsuccessful and 2) we should make any effort to support people who have lost their coal/factory/industry jobs due to technological progress,"The big argument I've seen for supporting industries like the coal industry is that failing to support those industries results in tremendous job loss and the further deterioration of the working class of America.  I don't necessarily disagree with the facts of that argument. I think it's probably true.

However  it seems hypocritical to me that a lot of the support for keeping these industries alive come from the right  which is ostensibly the side of the political aisle that believes in the free market and the fact that people who have lost their jobs should just ""get another one "" or people who are poor just aren't working hard enough. It seems weird to me that a right-wing individual would look at a coal miner's family living in poverty in West Virginia and think of them any differently than a family living in poverty in Queens. Shouldn't they all just figure out a way to make more money? That's what a lot of people in Queens (and lots of other inner cities) are told by the right.

This is somewhat connected to the recent discussions of DACA - it also seems weird to me that the right wants to send *away* from America the people who seem to embody the American Dream of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and getting an education/job/etc. The big argument against DACA and illegal immigrants is that ""they take jobs "" but again--why should any right wing person have sympathy for people who are losing their jobs to immigrants? Be better at your job. Accept lower pay and work two jobs. 

Can anyone reconcile these two ways of thinking?",244,0,0,13,18,"[['plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clean_power_plan).', 'words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqhl404zhcu),'], ['https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pull_oneself_up_by_one%27s_bootstraps'], ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/us_coal_production_-mining_type.png'], ['>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/us_coal_production_-mining_type.png'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['programs](https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/summary-immigrant-eligibility-restrictions-under-current-law)'], ['premises](http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/)'], ['now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wealth_inequality_in_the_united_states)', 'time](http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/22/news/economy/us-inequality-worse/index.html)'], ['premises](http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/)'], ['](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal_immigration_to_the_united_states#present-day_countries_of_origin)'], ['[third](http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/19/news/economy/undocumented-immigrant-taxes/index.html)'], ['people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/affirmative_action).', '85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/race_and_intelligence#united_states_test_scores)', 'us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heritability_of_iq).'], ['world.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_between_u.s._states_and_countries_by_gdp_(nominal)).', 'food](http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-calcook-california-its-whats-for-dinner-20140312-story.html).']]",0,70,0,Yes
"CMV: The class of ""tipped employees"" in the US should be abolished - minimum wage should be guaranteed for all.","The central problem with the idea of tipped employees in the US is access to justice and fluctuations in tips.

The premise behind the idea is to enable employers to pay their service employees less than minimum wage because their wages are made up for by the tips. But there are two huge problems with this

* Tips are not guaranteed. Social pressure makes them likely  but not certain

* If the employee doesn't get enough tips to technically have made minimum wage  what can they do? Are they going to demand the employer pays the difference? What if the employer says no - what is the employee going to do? Start a class action lawsuit to get their money back?

Given the difficulties in accessing justice and the fluctuations  the class of tipped employees isn't fair. People should be paid minimum wage.

"CMV: Americans should stop using the term ""hero"" to describe those who enlist in the military.","As an American  I find it common that the phrase ""hero"" is something used a lot to describe those who enlist in the military. I find that although there are definitely some troops who do heroic things  we should not simply throw the term ""hero"" around as some sort of umbrella term for those who enlist.

Obviously  there are some circumstances in which a soldier does something ""heroic"" and worthy of praise. I would say throwing yourself on a grenade to protect the others around you is definitely worthy of the term. However  there are many who enlist that never see a day of physical combat in their lives. To use the term ""hero"" to describe all people who serve is detracting from the accomplishments of those who really deserve it.

Also  using a word with such a powerful  positive connotation for all those of a particular profession is a bad idea because  although it's not fun to think about  some troops are just bad people. Enlisting doesn't give you a clean slate and a pure soul. Just like every other profession  those who are in the military are capable of doing both bad and good things. For example  there have been many cases of sexual assault within the institution. To say/act as if those who serve are immediately heroic individuals is to erase the crimes committed by these individuals as well as the experiences of the victims.

Immediately assuming someone who has enlisted is worthy of such a title is toxic  as it perpetuates the idea that these individuals are somehow ""above"" the normal citizen  and that they are incapable of making mistakes and/or immoral decisions. It makes it seem at though someone who has served is more than what they are  a human being capable of both right and wrong.",386,1,1,16,24,"[['lai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/my_lai_massacre),'], ['[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfpbgq-ttzm)'], [""[here's](https://www.quora.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-war)""], ['etc.](http://www.goarmy.com/benefits.html).'], ['http://time.com/4326676/dangerous-jobs-america/', 'http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/15/dying-for-a-paycheck-these-jobs-are-more-dangerous.aspx'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_spitting_image'], ['(http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/hero-dad-sacrificed-himself-save-6836703)', '(http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2575042/marine-24-left-disfigured-shielding-comrade-grenade-blast-afghanistan-receive-medal-honor.html).', '(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8024932/soldier-wins-military-cross-after-saving-wounded-afghan-child.html).'], ['(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8024932/soldier-wins-military-cross-after-saving-wounded-afghan-child.html)', 'child](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1340033/british-soldier-refused-shoot-insurgent-save-child.html).'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/other#academic_othering'], ['http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/deep-cravings.html'], ['http://youtu.be/x_x2yl7xw8u'], ['http://youtu.be/x_x2yl7xw8u'], ['7)](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#7)', '8)](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#8)', '9)](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#9)', '15)](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#15)', '16)](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#16)'], ['http://www.alternet.org/story/52233/the_making_of_an_american_soldier%3a_why_young_people_join_the_military'], ['article](http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/2016/06/authorities_3_train_workers_in_texas_wreck_presumed_dead),'], ['[](http://db3paramsstart']]",0,87,0,Yes
CMV: Britain is royally screwed.,"I voted remain. I have just woken up to the Leave victory. My concern is that today the pound has dropped 13% in value. We have no other trade agreements outside of the EU  meaning we will likely still have to trade with the EU under EU regulations. We haven't lost dependence on the EU but we have lost our say in those events. Cameron (who I'm not a fan of) has stepped down  meaning we could potentially end up with the second unelected prime minister in my lifetime. I'm very worried right now and would appreciate some help to see the bright side of this  preferably about some issue other than immigration because I feel that the issue has been so inflated into fearmongering that it's not likely to feel reassuring.

I've been researching the referendum for a while and my understanding of the subject is that a lot of people have chosen to vote leave because we were promised a) tighter immigration and b) money set aside for our priorities  e.g. the NHS. Immigration I don't think is being dealt with well since it's been presented as racism vs overidealism. The NHS funding promise was U-turned this morning within minutes of the results. It feels a little like the public have been misled  fearmongered and undereducated on the issue against their best interests.

CMV: Donald Trump's blatant use of his position to promote the businesses of himself and his family/punish those that go against is unethical and should be an impeachable offense.,"In the wake of Trump's tweets (retweeted by the OFFICIAL POTUS account) attacking Nordstrom for removing Ivanka's line  I am fearful of what appears to be the start of something like neopotism in the highest office of the U.S. Advertising/attacking certain companies equates to choosing who succeeds/fails (look at stock prices after he calls these companies out!) and the Trump families blatant refusal to divest themselves truly from their business amounts to unprecedented conflicts of interest. Worse  it is almost certain that nothing will be done about this by the Republican controlled congress  who seem content to let Trump be Trump as long as he allows them the chance to advance their party platform. It is my opinion that this SHOULD BE an impeachable offense  as it  first of all  shows that his interest in the presidency is significantly guided by Trump business ventures  and further  begins a worrying trend of putting companies at risk for going against him. Other companies could choose not to drop Trump businesses now  for fear of retaliation. We also have the L.L. Bean twitter advertisement by Trump to look at as an example of him rewarding donors and supporters. 

So yeah. Change my view.

CMV: Trump is being used to distract the media and the general public from policy changes.,"For example Trump's focus on the NFL has drowned out the noise that you might have expected from the failure to refund the CHIPS program to provide health insurance to children.

Trump has been steadily reshaping the political leanings of the [federal courts](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/339083-trump-reshapes-the-lower-federal-courts-with-little)
And whilst there are some outlets[reporting this](http://www.jpost.com/International/With-NFL-attacks-Trump-distracts-from-controversial-policy-moves-505938) most are not and instead are falling for some children's party level magic tricks ""look over there"" (whilst he palms the card from left to right hand)

CMV: Every business/government office should be required by law to be open outside of normal business hours (9-5) at least once a week,"For context  I work Mon-Fri 8am-6pm and every third Saturday 8am-1pm. My morning commute is about 20 minutes  while my evening commute is about 35 minutes. I get two weeks (80 hours) of PTO from my employer.

Ever since becoming an adult  I occasionally find myself in a situation where I have to handle certain task because of which I have to use PTO.

Here are a few examples:

* A few weeks ago I received a notice from the rental office that my apartment lease will be up soon. My choices are: automatically renewed for 12 months if I take no action; go to the office to sign a different term (not to renew the lease  month to month  3 months  6 months  9 months). However  the office is only open Mon-Fri 9a-5p. The lease has to be signed in person if I want anything other than to renew for 12 months. My only choice is to take time off from work if I want to get out of the lease  or be stuck for another 12 months here.

* Earlier this fall I decided to close and transfer a 401(k) from a job I had when I was in college (2005). I'm doing this because the bank currently servicing the account is increasing fees. So I opened an account with Vanguard and initiated a transfer. The only way for Vanguard and the other bank to complete this is for me to go to the other bank to get a signed and sealed letter approving this and send it to Vanguard  even though  there was only about $1 800 in this account. However  the other bank is only open Mon-Fri 9a-6p. I now have to take time off from work to get this done.

* This spring I needed to get a passport before traveling. Of course  the post office near my apartment and the one close to my work are both closed on weekends. So my only choice is to take time off from work to get a new passport

* I need an eye exam because I haven't had one in two years and guess what? The doctor's office is only open Mon-Fri 9am-5pm. If I want to get an eye exam  I have to take time off from work.

And don't even get me started if I need something from the local government office  or another type of doctor (I deal with this twice a year for dentist appointments).

Having said this  I think every business and or government office which requires its customers/residents/citizens to come in person or handle business over the phone  should be required by law to be opened outside of ""normal"" business hours of 9-5 at least once a week.

I know this probably wouldn't be a problem if every company in the US were required to give its employees plenty of PTO. And I know that there are people out there who have flexible jobs which let them leave work early/come in late/take longer lunches to handle things like this  but reality is  there are a lot of us who don't have jobs with flexible hours.

CMV: Having sexual preferences excluding transgender people is not transphobic,"Arguing that holding sexual preferences specifically excluding transgender people is transphobic is to conflate characteristics one finds sexually valuable with those one deems of holistic valueÑthat is  the worth of a human relative to others. Obviously  belief that transgender people have less worth than cisgender people is transphobic; doing so would use trans-status as a surrogate for holistic value. However  sexual preferencesÑa set of characteristics which indicate sexual value to a personÑdo not equate holistic value judgements. Given the distinction between a characteristic indicating sexual value and holistic value to a person  sexual preference as it relates to trans-status is not transphobic.

"CMV: Over the next 10-20 years, the biggest threat to most Americans will be the Republican party","I know that title sounds extreme and I'm not saying that Trump  most Republican voters or politicians are more evil than ISIS or North Koreas government but I do think they'll cause more harm  especially if they can get away with their ideas.

Firstly  they will further ruin race relations and civic culture in America. By electing an inexperienced bully (Trump)  supporting lying politicians who game the system (gerrymandering) and [strengthening white supremacists](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/charlottesville-and-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics/)  the Republican party will increase the amount of hatred and violence in America. While Republicans may condemn the death in Virginia and the shooting in Alexandria  both incidents were inevitable given their extremist actions.

Secondly  by practicing gerrymandering  manipulating laws regarding elections and obstructing democrats at every level (federal and municipal)  they will undermine democracy and further encourage hatred. By attacking the media and independent analysis  they undermine Americas ability to understand the problems it faces  encouraging the ignorance and stupidity that elected Trump.

Third  they will make killing people easier. Because of their support for guns  their support for violent police tactics and their recent laws which made it legal to hit protesters with their cars  Republicans will make it easier for Americans to kill each other in large numbers.

Fourth  their foreign policy is conducted by alt-right extremists  traditional aggressive Republicans and a thin skinned bully. This will only increase the chances of an attack from a terrorist group or rogue state while doing nothing to defeat them  as America will blunder through the rest of the world with no coherent strategy.

Fifth  climate change endangers the planet and Reoublicans' approach is to suppress this evidence to ensure they can maximise short term profits at the expense of future generations. This makes them  as Naomh Chomsky described  the most dangerous organisation in human history.

Sixth  their domestic policies will make America more indebted  poorer  less educated and less healthy. It will produce growth that reaches the wealthiest at the expense of most of the population. They will ruin the programs needed to help the poor improve themselves so they can enrich themselves  while blaming the declining living standards of their voters on the Chinese and Hispanic immigrants.

Finally while Republicans may think similar things about Democrats  that doesn't make them right. Democrats are more reasonable  informed  principled  moderate and open minded than Republicans and if they were in government America would be vastly better off in almost every respect.

"CMV: If the US is going to remove all memorials to white slave owners, they also need to remove all memorials to Native American slave owners (Statue of Chief Seattle in Seattle, Statue of Montezuma in San Diego, Chief Vann House Historic Site in Chatsworth, Georgia).","I believe that slavery is one of the worst  inhumane practices one human can impose on another human. I'm glad memorials to slave owners and defenders of slavery are being removed throughout the southern states. However  not only European-Americans owned slaves. Chief Seattle of the Duwamish nation  Emperor Montezuma of the Aztecs  and Chief Joseph Vann of the Cherokee nation practiced slavery. There are two statues of Chief Seattle in the city of Seattle  a statue of Montezuma at San Diego State University  and Vann's home now operates as a museum in rural Georgia. If America wants to completely condemn the practice of slavery  it should not only remove memorials to white slave owners  but also memorials to non-white slave owners.

CMV: Suicide is a basic human right,"I believe that any conscious being has a right to end their conscious at their will regardless of age  health  or social status. 

We do not understand the nature of consciousness and sentience  we do not understand the nature of death and it's effect on the consciousness.

There are people out there who may lead lives consumed in mental agony. If this individual discusses suicide with his or her friends  their friends will try anything in their power to prevent that. If this person fails a suicide attempt  they may be put on suicide watch or physically prevented from ending their consciousness.

When I was in jail  it saddened me how difficult the institution made it to kill yourself and if you failed  harsh punishments followed.

As it stands  none of us can scientifically and accurately measure the mental pain of another consciousness. None of us can scientifically compare the state of being conscious with the state of being dead.

The choice of whether to be or not should be left to any consciousness  and anything less is cruel.

CMV: The idea that taxation is theft is a clear sign of a failure in the educational system.,"In my travels through the internet I've read plenty of times the argument that taxation is a form of theft on the part of the government. I honestly think that this idea springs from a failure on the part of the educational system to explain how democratic societies work.

I can only talk about the education I had  so I think it's appropiate to point a few details. I'm from Argentina  where the Ministery of Education dictates what topics should be adressed during our 6 years of secondary school. From years 2-5 we have a subject called Citizen and Ethical Formation which focuses on teaching human rights  forms of discrimination  how the constitution and our goverment works  etc. 

So  one of the big points we are taught when it comes to taxation is that it is necesary for a society to function  a country can **not** rely solely on it's industry and exports to mantain a good level of life for its citizens.

To me  this idea that taxation is theft shows how little people understand about societies and how they function  but there may be a detail I'm missing  like political leaning or personal prejudice.

Anyway  I would like to hear specially from any American that thinks this way  almost every time I read about this argument it seems to come from our neighbours up north.

CMV:Suicide is an acceptable right of any adult even if they aren't physically in pain or dying.,"Not including people with deathly illnesses or with dibilitating and painful health issues.

I believe that people in emotional and psychological pain be allowed to commit suicide and that actions to stop them via the government and health officials is wrong. Additionally  I believe that intervention  by friends and family to seek help because of the family's own emotional reasons (ex: they will miss the suicidal person and be affected by such a situation) is wrong and should not be thrust upon the person as reasons to avoid what they believe is the solution to their problems. 

Here are some quotes from great thinkers on the subject:


> They tell us that Suicide is the greatest piece of Cowardice... That Suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in this world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.
> - Arthur Schopenhauer

Whereas  I reject such philosophical arguments like this: 

> He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself.
> - Kant

"CMV: Organ donation should be ""opt out"", not ""opt in"", in the U.S","In the U.S  organ donation is an option that people must select to participate in when they are getting a license or ID. The default setting is that everyone is ""opted out"" of the organ donation program and must actively choose to have their organs donated after their death. Instead of allowing people to ""opt in"" to organ donation  I believe the U.S. should make organ donation the default because it will result in more people donating their organs.

From a psychological standpoint  humans tend to gravitate towards decisions that have already been made for them. It is easier to go along with a premade decision than it is to change it. By requiring people to sign up for organ donation  the U.S. makes it unnecessarily difficult (albeit not that much) to be an organ donor.

In addition  the ""opt out"" policy has proven to get more people being organ donators than the ""opt in"" system. Stanford discussed this [here](https://sparq.stanford.edu/solutions/opt-out-policies-increase-organ-donation)  where they looked at Austria  a country that by default has everyone signed up as an organ donor. This results in around 90% of people donating their organs  compared with the ~15% donation rate in the U.S. 

There is a huge demand for organs in the U.S. to help save the lives of thousands of people. Many of these people are put on waiting lists but die before an organ is made available for them. The U.S. could potentially change this  or at least alleviate it  by adopting an ""opt out"" policy for organ donation.

Edit:
/u/cosmicr pointed out that the country referenced in the Stanford article was Austria  not Australia.

CMV: Jail time for unpaid child support is a modern day debtor's prison and also doesn't make sense as a concept.,"Hey CMV folks! I've been baffled by this practice for a while and I want to see if there's certain information I'm missing about it.

To start with  I absolutely believe that child support is necessary; if one parent is doing the majority of the caring for the child  the other person should be supporting the child financially. If one parent is responsible for making food for the kid and feeding them  the other is at least partially responsible for putting that food on the table and so on.

The part about child support laws that loses me is that someone who does not pay it gets sent to jail.

The reasons I disagree with it:

1. The logic seems to be  ""You can't afford to make this payment  so now  the government is going to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to lock you up and make it even harder for you to afford this payment.""

2. Giving someone a criminal record because they can't or won't pay something makes it harder for them to afford it given how many employers check criminal records before or when hiring someone.

3. Aren't debtor's prisons illegal?


Edit: Wow  this blew up! 
I have  as I've said in replies  changed my view somewhat. I'm glad there's more room in the system to screw up than I thought  and that things such as good faith payments exist. I also realized  from some of the stories people provided  that I have to change the view I had going in that everyone is inherently a good person and that there are two sides to a story- sometimes  people just suck.
I still don't fully agree with the concept of jail time for unpaid child support as it has such a harmful effect on the person's ability to make future payments- criminal record  employment gap  potentially losing a job because of inability to work  potentially losing a bed in a homeless shelter  being ineligible for public assistance in the future- but those are on the whole problems with our justice and employment laws than with child support laws.
Thanks guys for the discussion!

CMV: The names of mass shooters should not be released to the public.,"I feel like in many cases  most notably the Columbine  mass shooters do what they do for some sort of infamy. Whether they are dead or not after the fact they know that their name will live on. They become some sort of celebrity in the world of psychopaths and that plays into why they do what they do. 

If their names aren't recognized  they can't get the recognition they want.

"CMV: Abortion is preferable to raising a child on an unstable financial foundation, and it shouldn't be regulated on a federal level.","I'd consider myself mostly conservative  but still have some rather liberal ideas and this is one of them. Abortion has always been a really tough issue for me and I used to oppose it until I had a pregnancy scare with my SO. We were only 19 and her period was late. I was terrified  praying to the heavens to not have a child this early  that I'm not ready. Luckily  she got it eventually. But I'll never forget that heart-sinking feeling in my chest and it's made me a lot more empathetic towards those who get abortions.

However  I'd still like to hear all angles of this argument. Most conservative commentators don't go beyond ""it's killing babies and Jesus"" and seems to be the one issue where facts aren't brought into question. So for those who are against it  please shed insight that isn't religiously-related. For those who are Pro-Life  I'd love to hear your perspective on this and answer these points:

1. Unintended pregnancy rates for those below the poverty line are extremely high compared to higher-income families  but abortion keeps that rate *somewhat* stable so that it doesn't reach unintended birth. I believe that having a child prematurely in the midst of poor economic standing is the root of a LOT of our societal problems. Most conservatives also hate how many are on welfare  and I'd bet that many of those on it are due to having children prematurely. **Why is abortion a worse outcome than raising a kid in the midst of personal financial turmoil?**

2. Teens are notoriously promiscuous with all the hormones raging during that age  many losing their virginity at age 13-14. Even with contraceptives like condoms and birth control  accidents can happen. **What would you suggest to a person pregnant in High School  if not abortion? Should she really (potentially) suffer throughout her entire life with this mistake she made as a reckless teen  even if she used contraceptives?**

3. **At what point in pregnancy does it become a ""life"" and why?** Some conservatives believe that it's a child at the MOMENT of conception. **Does this mean that Plan B is just at immoral as abortion? Would you compromise or make exceptions for early stages of pregnancy?**

4. As I've said  even with contraceptives  accidents can still happen. Sex is a huge driving force in our lives and we don't really notice how strongly our libido impacts our decision-making. **What could possibly be a solution to this major problem of unintended pregnancy?** Pre-marital sex is just not viable  an unrealistic goal.


5. Conservatives usually oppose a strong federal government that can regulate a person's life choices  such as wearing seatbelts. **Do you believe abortion should be illegally mandated all across the nation  or is it a states' right issue  and why?**

6. I know this is an extremely rare margin of abortion cases  but **what would you suggest for rape victims? Surely they shouldn't be forced to care for a child that they had no choice in preventing  right?**


Looking forward to reading these answers!

"CMV: There's nothing inherently wrong with letting one-job towns ""die off"".","In generations past  people commonly moved to mill towns  mining towns  etc.  for the opportunity provided. They would pack up their family and go make a new life in the place where the money was. As we've seen  of course  eventually the mill or the mine closes up. And after that  you hear complaints like this one from a currently-popular /r/bestof thread: ""Small town America is forgotten by government. Left to rot in the Rust Belt until I'm forced to move away. Why should it be like that? Why should I have to uproot my whole life because every single opportunity has dried up here by no fault of my own?""

Well  because that's how you got there in the first place.

CMV:If Women have the right to be Pro-Choice then Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood.,"Hello CMV!

First of all regarding my own ideas and politics  I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism  freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.
I believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not  women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept  or opt out of  fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.

I understand that the state assumes the right of the child > the right of the parent  however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.

Or on the opposite  if a mother is given the option to keep a child  willingly knowing the father does not want to  then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself  as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.
Obviously this excludes rape and all other implications  this is only within consensual sex.

TL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood  and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for  in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.

EDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion  I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not  it is her ""pro choice""  however fathers have the right to ""opt out"" of fatherhood  or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.
EDIT2: This is going pretty well  some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood"". 
TheScamr worded this nicely:
>Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother  either financially  custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood  either financially  custodially or emotionally.

EDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion  so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women  the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father  but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.

CMV: To become a police officer should require a four year degree,"I have a firm belief that many instances of police brutality could be avoided through proper education. To become a police officer should require a specially designed degree suited for the areas of knowledge required by a good cop. Local history  criminology  local/federal law  martial arts  local geography  and the most important one of all: psychology. I can not believe we send these men and women out there unprepared to deal with everything from arguing spouses to murders without training them to understand *why* these people act the way they do. 

An example of how psychology could help:

A cop that constantly fidgets is going to encourage the citizen to either run or fight. Here's why. In that moment where you have a cop with gun pointed at a 'zen  the cop is the threat. No matter if the the 'zen is completely innocent  you understand. His lizard brain is already in control  he could die  this is serious. Now  if the threat moves  your brain is going to tell you to react. If the threat stays still  your brain is likely to wait to see what the threat does so it can react accordingly. So what happens when a cop fidgets? The 'zen's brain is already caught in this loop of Run?!FightNooFightNO!RUN???NO!!! All that movement just encourages the brain to subconsciously choose for you and simply *act*  bypassing your active suppression. So many of these encounters could be solved and avoided with basic psychology.

Beyond actually preparing them for what they're up against  is that it SHOULD be hard to do. It shouldn't be this easy to be the arm of the law. I know it isn't like applying to Taco Bell  but it should be almost as rigorous as med school  in my opinion. Which is a sight harder than it is now. Just institute it  grandfather in cops with a certain amount of experience. Allow current cops without enough experience to keep jobs but attended one class per semester. Allow cops for next four years to get jobs  but only if they attend classes. First crop of degree cops come up  now require a degree always. 

Anyhow  poke holes in my 4-year degree specifically designed for cops idea (not just any degree  but one required for cops). CMV.

"CMV: Companies should be fines the amount they make from breaking the law, instead of a standard amount.","When a company does something like dump chemicals in the ground because itÕs cheaper than disposing of them properly  theyÕll make tons of money from it. I donÕt blame companies for this- their goal is to make as much money as they can while spending as little as they can. If they get caught  the punishment is usually a fine  as opposed to some form of incarceration. This fine can be much less than the amount the company made breaking the law. Often  the explanation I see for why a company will do this not just once  but again and again is because they make more than the fee costs. Why shouldnÕt we charge them the amount they made?

"CMV: In attempting to be neutral and present both sides of an idea or issue, the media actually creates false equivalencies which misleads the public into believing the two sides are equal.","I'm a firm believer that the media over represented Trump leading up to the election in an effort to appear balanced and neutral. This often meant twisting and skewing Trump's (lack of) rhetoric to make it seem of equal validity to the policy proposed by Clinton.

But they are not equal.

Clinton clearly outlined the exact steps of her plans  and what she wanted to do on a given issue. Trump either didn't present a policy (ISIS  Aleppo)  or presented a rhetoric based entirely on vague (MAGA)  or blatantly false (Climate change is a hoax) pretense.

This actually causes the media to be *less* neutral by giving undeserved credence to Trump's platform  but comparing it as equal to Clinton's.

There are other issues where the media does the same thing by bringing in a dissenting view on issues that have been factually proven and concluded. In other words  there is no rational dissenting view for:

* Climate change is caused by humans.

* The Earth was created billions of years ago  not thousands.

* No race is intellectually superior to another.

This perpetuation of false equivalencies misleads the public into thinking that two things are equal and opposite  as opposed to unequal.

CMV: As a trans person I believe that current trans activism has completely lost the plot. They will lose much of the public debate they choose to engage in due to their overly radical agenda.,"My argument is largely philosophical so it's somewhat malleable and I legitimately would like yo see it changed. I would prefer to believe in and support current trans activism whole-heartedly but far too often find myself shaking my head instead. There's a few points on which I base my contention:

~~**As a trans woman I do not believe that I am biologically female and I dont believe that I should have to be to access women's spaces.** I'm female like and function well enough as one. I look female. I experience much of if not the majority of the same baggage as biological females. I'm more physically like a female than a male and pose about as much danger to females as any other female due to the effects of hormones. Despite this I know that if nature had been left to its own devices I would have been completely capable of reproducing through the production of male sex gametes: sperm. Furthermore I still have male reproductive organs  they've simply been switched off by the effects of long term hormone replacement therapy and potentially could function completely again on the cessation of hormones. I think it is an inherently unwinnable fight to argue that I am biologically female based on nothing more than the (potential and unproven) configuration of my brain hardware.~~

~~**I have seen trans activism push an agenda that states that biological sex is an entirely socially constructed concept based on the existence of intersex people.** I think this makes about as much sense as saying that because Orange exists  red and yellow aren't real colors. Biological sex is at its core about sex gametes. In the absence of a reproductive system that functionally produces one  its relatively easy to deduce which gamete a person's biology was *intended* to  produce   even in the presence of the overwhelming majority of intersex conditions  and even at an extreme enough end that you can argue an intersex person is not neatly either male or female  males and females still exist independent of them.~~

~~**How this hurts trans activism goals:** If trans activism spent less time trying to convince people that biological sex is made up and more time educating people about the effects hormones have on trans bodies I believe that we would be much further into achieving our social and political goals by now. I believe that we are bogged down in an unwinnable and inherently disingenuous fight. We are driving away people who believe in rationalism and science a la people who would actually be very receptive to treating transgenderism as a medical condition with a very specific and unorthodox  treatment regimen and instead of trying to sway them with an argument that appeals to their natures we are fighting them with unscientific rhetoric.~~

**Edit: I have actually changed my view at this point regarding biological sex. /u/convoces raised to me a really good point that if you can point to an exception within your paradigm  then the scientifically honest thing to do is rethink your paradigm. If 100% of cases do not work within it  then it was too broad. I've come to believe that sex is nuanced  and while someone might not necessarily fall within a strict ""female"" category  that does not necessarily indicate that they are males. Rather biological sex is a mix of different characteristics which are not always able to be defined neatly  and the social role a person lives in is as important if not more important than potentially invisible characteristics.**

**I have seen trans activists push a ""genitals don't matter"" argument when it comes to sex and dating.** While I do not believe that a man dating a preop trans woman is ""gay""  genitals are very important to many people when it comes to sex. Trans activism states that this reduces people solely to their genitals  but it's frankly terrifyingly batshit to argue to people that the parts used in sex should not matter when it comes to sex. It is not transphobic for someone to not want a particular configuration of genitals in their bedroom. That is their prerogative.

**How this hurts trans activism:** I have seen lesbians show up in /r/relationships and /r/asktransgender threads describing being shamed and ostracized by their friends for not wanting to sleep with trans women.  I have seen gay men do the same regarding trans men. The LGB community has typically had a strong association with the T community and they are all potential allies. We are united in the ways we are stigmatized. Yet  when we are the ones doing the stigmatizing we risk alienating them from our cause.

~~**And lastly I have seen trans activists argue that you do not need to be gender dysphoric to be transgender  merely self identified as something other than your birth sex.** This fundamentally makes no sense and runs contrary to the entire pathology of what it means to be transgender. It's as fundamentally incorrect as arguing that gay men dont have to be sexually attracted to men to be gay  you just have to self identify. Gender dysphoria is integral to shaping a transgender identity. This particular argument seems purely ideological: that people should be allowed to identify as whatever sex they feel like because gender is dead and anything goes. I believe at minimum this actually reinforces sexist gender roles since believing that because you are effeminate or gender non-conforming as a man (or the inverse as a woman) actually makes you the other sex or a third sex undermines the progress feminism has made to insist that women can be masculine and still women or that men can be feminine still men. ~~

~~**How this hurts trans activism:** after countless conversations with cis opponents of pro-trans bathroom laws I've come to the conclusion that most cisgender people could care less what someone who has transitioned does and where they go the bathroom. Their primary fear comes from the wording typically being used: ""the gender they identify as"". Cis people are most afraid of there being no standards whatsoever imposed on access to sex segregated spaces. When we're arguing that there should be no bare minimum standards for being identified as the opposite sex we are playing directly into those fears. When cis people are afraid that men will ""wake up and decide they are a woman"" why are we arguing ""that's not how it works!"" then turning around and in different conversations arguing that its exactly how it works?~~

~~**In summation:** I believe that by embracing radical and untrue tenents based on ideological goals rather than objective reality trans activism is actually driving away potential supporters and otherwise reasonable people who could be potential allies.~~

**Edit: Thanks to /u/iyzie pointing out the scary possibility or republican lawmakers being charged by the evangelical right with determining who is and isn't transgender enough I've partially changed my view on ""non-dysphoric trans people"". I haven't necessarily changed my view that they are not actually transgender people  only that it is dangerous to start drawing lines in the sand to determine who is and is not legitimate  and that once you establish that power for a reasonable group it becomes easier for unreasonable groups to seize that power. So what I have changed my view on is that trans activists pushing the view that ""anyone can be trans"" is not necessarily harmful because they are rightfully trying to avoid a legitimate slippery slope.**

"CMV: Even if climate change is not real or man-caused, all of the acts being recommended to counter it should happen anyway.","Abandoning fossil fuels for cleaner alternatives. Regardless of whether they cause global warming  they pollute our cities and destroy the air quality.

Ending deforestation of the rainforests. We want to preserve the habitat of rare animals and the natural beauty.

Improving public transportation. Traffic congestion is a bitch  and if I had a subway or rail system nearby to take me where I needed to go  I would love it. Cars are expensive and require your attention for the duration of your commute.

This is by no means an exhaustive list  but definitely the big ones I've seen a lot. It's possible that there's some other action being recommended for climate change that I've overlooked or forgotten. 

I don't believe that destroying the coal industry to grow green energy industries is a bad thing. So if you have a view of the financial aspect that's not protecting a certain industry that's more than welcome as well!

Edit: It seems that most people are bringing up economic or financial arguments. I think /u/10ebbor10 argued better than most could as to why this is a good reason  but I don't think any financial or economic argument could sway me. If you've got any negative effects of these acts or other commonly-touted acts that you think I don't know  please still share!

"CMV:If Russia's goal in interfering with the 2016 election was to ""undermine public faith in the US democratic process"" then they have already succeeded.","The released intelligence report states -

While the secondary goal may have been a preference for a Trump presidency  it makes one question why this would be the case. Russia is no fool  and I believe that they understood a Trump presidency would garner just the results that we see now...a wildly unpopular president  at least with both the media and congress  and a much more divided nation. I don't think that anyone could disagree that half of the country that actually cares lost their minds when Trump won. We've seen unprecedented levels of [vitriolic rhetoric](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-women-madonna-idUSKBN15704A) in regards to his presidency  [unprecedented levels of negative media coverage](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-donald-trumps-first-100-days/)  and [even an attempt to assassinate republicans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/multiple-people-injured-after-shooting-in-alexandria/2017/06/14/0289c768-50f6-11e7-be25-3a519335381c_story.html?utm_term=.229ab6be40c2) 

Trumps presidency has been overshadowed by scandalous allegations since he was elected  and six months into his term  [articles of impeachment have already been introduced](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-rep-brad-sherman-just-introduced-1499883664-htmlstory.html).

Now  much of negative coverage has been of Trump's own doing  but at the same time  I believe that the media focus on scandal is far outweighing and serious reporting on policy  and the Russian's knew that electing a divisive figure like Trump  with no political experience  would lead to exactly what we are seeing play out  a scandal ridden news cycle with nothing but negativity and division.

So long as the media continues to focus on scandals and allegations rather than policy and results  and the congress continues to devote resources to investigations rather than legislation  then Russia has succeeded undermining our electoral processes by disrupting the focus of both the american people and the congress by focusing attention away from policy.

CMV: Not investing in educational capital (to the extent of other nations) is one of the greatest national security threats to the US during our generation.,"As we have seen  wars have continually been fought with heightened technology - tactical decisions are made with counterintelligence gathered with the most advanced tools developed. WWIII will not be fought in the streets  it will consist of drones  utility/infrastructure cyber attacks  and immense propaganda/misinformation.

By not placing an emphasis on STEM education in public schools  we are placing the next generation of US citizens in danger of falling behind academically and defensively. I believe this because the way war is waged has drastically changed and to remain one of the bastions of democratic security  we need to treat the funding of education as a security threat.

"CMV: If white people being scared of black people on the street is racist, then women being scared of men on the street is sexist.","I was just reading [this](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/an-open-letter-to-all-my-male-friends?CMP=fb_gu) article and was again reminded of an analogy I have heard a few times before that seems to me correct. If it is the case that it is racist for a white person to be afraid of a black person walking toward them  then it is sexist for a woman to be afraid of a man walking toward her. I have heard this analogy a few times but have yet to hear any good reasons for there being a morally relevant difference between the two cases - if one is wrong  so is the other. 

To be clear  my view is **not** that women being afraid of men on the street **is** sexist or wrong. My view is slightly more subtle; it is that there is no morally relevant difference between a women being afraid of men on the street and a white person being afraid of a black person on the street. If one is wrong  so is the other.

CMV: The fat acceptance movement normalizes obesity.,"People come in all shapes and sizes and promoting body positivity is great  but I am not convinced that we should throw our hands up and encourage people to maintain unhealthy lifestyles because they can't or don't want to lose weight. Fat people are the target of discrimination and bullying due to their weight  which is undeniably wrong. But *promoting* fatness is not the way to support fat people. 
I understand that defining health is a complex issue and it's not as easy saying ""that person has some extra lbs  therefore they aren't healthy"" but the fat acceptance movement's sheltering of obesity normalizes poor health. Obesity is a serious problem and the fat acceptance movement allows us to bypass facing the obesity epidemic as a society. There are major systematic changes that we  as a society  need to address in order to have a healthier populous  and accepting that obesity is okay or promoting it is a barrier to the hard work of changing the way our culture treats food  diet  and exercise. 
People deserve respect  but part of that respect should include real discussions about weight and finding better ways to support people.

Edit: To illustrate a few examples of the trends I've seen and point out the difference between the intent of the movement and the byproduct(s) of it- (I'm on mobilize so I apologize for formatting)

There are a number of fativits who write about how being fat is good  I've interpreted that as promoting fatness/obesity.
Examples:
 [I'm FAt. It's OK](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-22468/im-fat-its-ok-heres-why-we-all-need-to-get-a-little-more-comfy-with-the-f-wo.html)

[Photo Series Proves Fat is Beautiful](http://www.glamour.com/gallery/adipositivity-project-photos)

[Glorifying Obesity](http://www.fatgirlflow.com/glorifying-obesity/)

You can find [Fat is Fabulous](https://www.tumblr.com/search/fat%20is%20fabulous) posts all over Tumblr and other social media sites. 


I think the difference here is the original intent of the movement. I see that the intent of the movement is to end discrimination against fat people  but I think many individuals use that as a scapegoat to normalize obesity. Cathy Young wrote a succinct article that reflects my thoughts that may be a better descriptor - [Pro Fat An Unhealthy Status Quo](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/12/30/fat-acceptance-hazardous-health/1ojfoW46R2elWpHLarA19M/story.html)

EDIT 2: POST CMV -
A number of people have illustrated the difference between the fat acceptance movement and the fat *people* acceptance movement  which is the key differentiator for me. Yes  there are radicals (as in any movement) who take the message further to say that obesity (the illness) is healthy  which is not true. But as I understand  the moderates of the fat acceptance movement simply aim to normalize the existence of obese people in an effort to make their lives less hellacious. There are a lot of people who are hung up on the normalizing aspect of this thread and who have pointed out that of course the movement aims to normalize obesity. I posted this thread with a common understanding that obesity  the illness  is bad  and should not be upheld  glorified  promoted  etc... That said  I understand there are differentiating interpretations on the word ""normalizing"". I see the point that normalizing doesn't always equate to condoning  as in  we should normalize mental health issues  but that does not mean we glorify mental health problems. Thus  I think my real issue here has been associating the movement and it's intent with radicals. I would  therefore  appreciate links to resources that are upstanding representations of moderate thinkers of the fat acceptance movement. Thanks to everyone for your input  thought provoking conversation and for changing my view!

To me  this attitude is so condescending and ignorant of the begger's situation. The person might've just hit a rough patch in life  they might be too occupied with familial issues  maybe they have a mental illness making it hard to get a job. 

There are plenty of reasons for why that person can be poor  and it doesn't help them at all if we yell and hound them to ""just get a job"". It is inconsiderate to expect them to just help themselves  and it would be much kinder to give them spare change if they beg for it. CMV.

In addition  the reason the U.S. Is so successful is because it had European allies. We've lost those  and now it is us  Russia  and China against the world. Nuclear war is very much possible. And don't forget  our Vice President-elect is a young earth creationist! We can say goodbye to science education!

CMV: Bernie Sanders supporters who are voting for Trump over Hillary are either behaving irrationally or should not have supported Sanders in the first place.,"There is no legitimate reason for a Sanders voter to vote for Trump over Hillary.  Hillary and Sanders are far more ideologically similar than Trump and Sanders.  Hillary and Sanders voted on the same side in the Senate on bills 93% of the time.  To put that in perspective  Hillary voted the same as Republicans less than 40% of the time.  On virtually every single issue Hillary is closer to Sanders than Trump.

Hillary is untrustworthy and has a record of unprincipled flip-flopping  granted.  But  you would have to be delusional to believe that Donald Trump is any more honest.  He lies compulsively.  He said the unemployment rate is somewhere between 28-40%  that blacks kill 81% of white homicide victims  which is wildly inaccurate  that John Oliver begged him to be on his show when John Oliver has never talked to him  that he (Trump) was virulently opposed to the Iraq war before the war started  that Ted Cruz's dad associated with Lee Harvey Oswald  along with a million other lies.

Not to mention Trump himself is either lying about his actual positions  or  he is one of the stupidest people to ever become the nominee for a major party.  Possibly the most important issue we face in the near future is global warming.  Trump said that:

""""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""

In my mind that is the single dumbest  most worrying  and all around buffoonish statement I've ever seen of someone running for President.

And for those who call Hillary a hawk  Trump wants to send 20-30k troops into Syria to fight ISIS and start capturing and torturing the wives and children of suspected terrorists.  

The only legitimate reason for a Sanders supporter to vote for Trump is they never really shared Sanders' ideals in the first place

CMV: Kneeling for the Anthem does not disrespect the USA,"I say this as a Canadian who has been following the Anthem Protests relatively closely.

The USA is not a flag. The USA is not a song.

The USA is a collection of thoughts and ideals. Among which three are central

1 - Everyone should be treated equally/fairly.

2 - The government is not perfect.

3 - If you don't like something  you have the right to voice your displeasure (sometimes with weapons).

Therefore kneeling before a flag during a song which isn't your nation  but exercising your belief in the ideas that are your nation  is not disrespectful of the nation.

> But your disrespecting the people who fought and died for that flag

If they fought and died for the flag moreso than they did foe the ideals which it is supposed to represent  then I would argue they deserve the disrespect.

> They are disrespecting a nation which has given them those rights

And therefore using those rights should come before paying lip-service to a flag which represents things you don't agree with.

Things that would change my view

* That the flag  anthem  and government should be more important than those listed ideals
* That those listed ideals are wrong
* That kneeling is not a good form of protest

Edit - Apparently I need to point out that I awarded a delta. 

Well I awarded a delta.

"CMV:You should be able to sue lenders and banks for issuing credit to an identity thief impersonating you, thus ruining your credit score.","Let me restate that - you should be able to successfully sue the bank  or anyone else  giving them credit in your name.

It only makes sense to steal an identity when the thief gets something out of it.  A useless identification is not worth the trouble.  So  if a bank or lender gives an identity thief credit in your name you should be able to successfully sue the bank for not doing due diligence to ensure they are really dealing with ""you"".

A side effect of this would be more in-person transactions and more personalized service  which may be slightly slower or cost slightly more  but the results would be well worth it for society as institutions would be forced to ""get to know"" their clients a little more and identity theft would be reduced as thieves knew they couldn't use your credit from afar.

EDIT- many people havr given good answers and mentioned how secure loans are.  If that's the case why are so many identities sill stolen? If it's very tough to get a benefit frim the theft why do it?

CMV: Feminist rhetoric surrounding privilege enforces an us-versus-them mentality and we need to change the dialogue,"IÕm mostly just interested to see what other people think. For the record I am a man and identify as a feminist. 

My biggest observation about feminism today is that a LOT of people in my age group have a negative opinion of feminism. Particularly itÕs common for those deemed ÒprivilegedÓ (ie white  straight  and/or male) tend to be extremely defensive about it. They feel theyÕre being attacked  and not always without reason. 

IÕll give an example. A guy says something wrongheaded about a feminist topic. The feminists respond saying he doesnÕt understand and he basically doesnÕt deserve to have an opinion on the topic because he is a straight white male. A large part of (or all of) the response is an ad hominem. This isnÕt necessarily the intended use of these terms  but this is how I see it being applied. Now he feels personally attacked for factors he canÕt control and excluded from the conversation. A potential ally is a lot more likely to have a negative opinion about ÒfeminismÓ now.

I would go so far as to say that pointing out his race in this scenario is  in fact  racist. Except the definition of racism that has been floating around specifically excludes racism against whites: Òprejudice plus powerÓ implies that only white people can be racist  while other races cannot be racist towards whites. This is exactly the kind of thing that makes a lot of people feel attacked. Our definition of racism is very one-sided and doesnÕt reflect the reality that a member of any race can be racist towards anyone. As a result IÕve noticed jokes about white people have become commonplace in our culture  while jokes about other races are not acceptable. If we agree that racist jokes are not okay that should apply to everyone.

ÒPrivilegeÓ itself has a very negative connotation. No one wants to be told theyÕre privileged. The concept does have an important place in the conversation - I am not a woman and I may not always understand a womanÕs perspective. ItÕs important to keep that kind of thing in mind. But from the outset just calling someone privileged and stopping at that is offensive. 

This might not sound like that big of a deal but its driving a wedge between feminists and non-feminists. As I said itÕs become quite common for people my age to have negative opinions about feminism  and frankly all the self-described feminists I know are very aggressive and condescending.

CMV: Transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military.,"Now that Trump recently announced that transgender people are not going to be allowed to serve in the military I want to try to understand the reasoning behind this decision. Transgender people have been fighting for America for some time now and from what I understand this haven't been a larger issue so far. 

Considering that both men and women are serving in the military I don't see how this could make a difference. It would be one thing if women weren't serving and female to male transgender people wanted to join. Considering this is not the case I don't see the logic behind it.

Furthermore I don't understand how Trump can justify making this decision since some transgender people voted for him. Trump said he would work for the LGBTQ+ community and by doing this he is failing some of his voters on a (according to me) non logic decision.",478,3,17,59,69,"[['http://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/a-mixed-military-bag-for-people-with-diabetes'], ['http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/ajph.2013.301241'],

CMV: I DonÕt Believe In Saying The Pledge In School.,IÕm an American high schooler  and like most we say the pledge  second period  day after day. Almost none of the students actually say it (at least out loud). I am among those many. I often question  Òwhat if I donÕt want to pledge allegiance to the ÔrepublicÕ? What if I feel America is rapidly declining and I no longer believe in what the government and America stand for?Ó Its hard for me to see how to interpret this in any other way. I also dislike the part about Òone nation  under GodÓ. This strikes me as odd because whoÕs to say America is Òunder GodÓ   even under any gods  if any at all. I thought the government wasnÕt supposed to promote any specific religion? Finally  Òliberty and justice for all.Ó I donÕt believe there is justice for all  (or at least not ÒjustÓ justice). There are so many court cases where  for example  a black person is treated unjustly  in modern day America. I just donÕt see why we say the pledge anymore if  in my opinion  it is so wrong. People arenÕt even thinking about what they are saying anymore.

"I believe that we should have a 'Reverse Boot Camp' when veterans return from active duty, in order to better transition them back into society. CMV","So  from my limited understanding of this  I've read that PTSD and Depression (just two examples) are reaching [ridiculous levels](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/10/prweb11195568.htm) [of diagnosis.](http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Depression&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=88939) It would seem that coming back from the events of war causes significant changes in one's mental state  and that transitioning back to society is extremely difficult  even for the soldiers who are 'fine.'

Now  we know a lot of ways to [combat PTSD](http://www.helpguide.org/mental/post_traumatic_stress_disorder_symptoms_treatment.htm) [and depression](http://www.helpguide.org/mental/depression_tips.htm)  and [there's new studies coming out all the time  so it's clearly something we as a society care about](http://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html).

It just seems to me that generally  American society continually spouts the whole  ""I support the troops"" mindset  but what does that really mean? The biggest problems that face troops don't have to do with supplies  funding  or a lack of training going into the conflict  but their transition back into society afterwards. We train them to go *into* the conflict  why would we not train them to *come out* of it?

If we **know** that many  many troops struggle with this  and we **know** how to treat it (obviously each case is different  but I mean as an overarching topic we do know treatment methods)  it seems like a no brain-er that we should be doing something about it. In my mind  the best way to do this would be to have some sort of mandatory program for soldiers when they return. It could be just a month or two long (after which those soldiers who still need help will at least have the resources readily available to them)  and it would consist of living and working as a group to achieve peaceful goals  possibly [raising animals](http://www.helpguide.org/life/pets.htm)  [spending a lot of time outside](http://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html)  etc etc. Even for those soldiers who aren't suffering from these serious issues would benefit from some down time to reduce stress levels and transition back into everyday life.

**EDIT: /u/groovyoctopus suggested possibly doing volunteer work  I thought it was worth mentioning up here as well so new readers could see it.**

The money for all of this  in the perfect world  would come from all the excess military spending that this country pumps out (if you don't believe that  just [Google excess military spending](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=excess+military+spending) and see what comes up).

One final supporting point is that [over half of all enlisted forces are between the ages of 18-30](http://www.statisticbrain.com/demographics-of-active-duty-u-s-military/). This means that most people who are enlisted are still relatively young  and have not spent a lot of time off in the real world on their own. So another argument is that since they have not spent a lot of time interacting with society as a regular citizen  then they have very little to 'fall back' on in terms of old habits or old feelings to relate to.

So that's the thinking behind my view. I'm really interested in reading some arguments as to why we **don't** already do this.

Thanks everyone!

P.S. I understand that funding might be the biggest issue people are going to raise. I would prefer to hear other arguments against this  because funding is the most apparent/easiest one to spot  but also the easiest one to refute.

P.P.S. This whole topic was sparked in my mind over this recent [This American Life story](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/515/transcript) (skip to ""Deep  Dark  Open Secret"").

EDIT: I've already clarified in comments below  so instead of posting the same thing to each reply  the program would definitely provide ample time to spend with family and friends. I think that the program could be structured in such a way that veterans could commute to the camp in order to preform tasks  much like a 9-5 job. It would not necessitate being away from their families for another month or two after the end of deployment.

EDIT #2: Also  the details of the program aren't what matters so much about my post. If you have suggestions about what soldiers could be doing during this reverse boot camp time  I'd gladly hear them. However  my view isn't so much about *what* they should be doing to re-integrate  but the fact that they should be doing *something*  and that *something* should be organized and paid for by the military that put them in a combat zone.

EDIT #3: For anyone who want's to say that we already have programs in place (like individual counseling  etc)  I am aware of that  and that is a valid point. However  before you post it  I'd like you to take a look at [veteran suicide rates](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/14/169364733/u-s-militarys-suicide-rate-surpassed-combat-deaths-in-2012)  or just google it if you don't like that article. They're out of control. So it would appear that the system we have in place isn't working. If you have evidence to refute that  I'd love to read up on it.

**EDIT #4: It has been brought to my attention that re-integration programs do exist in each branch of the military (I guess someone thought this was a good idea before!). However  from the descriptions I've read they sound terribly ineffective (extremely dry  boring  no one takes them seriously  etc). I guess the CMV has transitioned from ""There should be these programs "" to ""These programs need to change."" Thanks to everyone for their input so far! I'll do my best to keep replying below  but at this point I guess changing my original view is impossible because these programs already exist.

CMV: Supporters of President Trump should not be mocked or ignored if Democrats want to win elections,"For the record  I grew up in a small  conservative town and many of my relatives  regrettably  voted for Trump. I'm what some on the right might stereotype as a ""liberal coastal elite"" (live in a coastal metropolis  have graduate degree  have worked in media  appreciate science and good grammar).

Since the election  I've seen a subset of liberals - many of my friends included - go on to denounce all Trump supporters as (insert pejorative here) who should not be engaged with on any level because ""you can't reason with stupid"" (I'm paraphrasing here  but you get the gist). This same group often mocks things like blue collar jobs  ""flyover states "" agricultural work  and those without college degrees. 

To me  this perspective feeds the narrative promulgated by ""the political right"" (RNC  Fox News  etc.) of the Democratic Party/liberals being out of touch/elitist/unable to help the ""common man."" In my mind  it is crucial that we engage with Trump voters in a way that 1) makes them feel heard  and 2) addresses issues important to them. 

Mocking  ignoring  or calling Trump supporters names is counterproductive to the goal of electing progressives/liberals/dems into office. CMV.

edit / point of clarification: many seem to take my argument to mean ""the only way for democrats to win elections is to flip Trump voters"" because I say it is ""crucial"" that we engage them. I concede that this wording supports this conclusion  but what I mean to say is that it is simply *very important* that we engage with Trump supporters.

"CMV: Only registered organ donors should be able to receive an organ transplant, or at the very least, get priority on the transplant waiting list.","There is an organ shortage in many countries around the world (at least  those where you aren't put on the organ donor list by default and must actively opt-out). I'm a Canadian and in Canada last year  there were only 500 organ donors. A country of 35 million. We have a severe shortage of organ donors  yet so many people that need an organ to live.

A lot of people--in fact  I feel the majority of people--take transplantation for granted. They don't give thought to the fact that  if they get injured or sick and need a transplant  that organ actually needs to come from *somewhere*  *someone*  who has given consent to donate their organ upon death. It's really only those who are unfortunate enough to require an organ  and are sitting on the waiting list  without the privilege of having a living matching donor in their life  that really understand how scarce and valuable a resource organ donation is. Despite receiving the form at each stage of acquiring your driver's license  many people just toss the form into the trash without much thought.

I think there needs to be more awareness  and information  and bluntness  around the issue. We *are* going to die. And we will have no use for our organs. At the very least  pass over your solid organs to one of the many  many people who can get new life from it. Keep your tissues. You can save up to 5 lives.


And so  I think that  as a solution to this issue  only registered organ donors should be allowed to receive an organ transplant  should they fall ill. Or  at the very least  registered organ donors should be given priority above non-registered individuals. Make it common knowledge  make it known  and there will be more people actively considering and signing up to become donors.

Change my view.

**EDIT**: I didn't realize I needed to include a common-sense clause. Those who are ill or who would otherwise not be eligible for organ donation  as well as those under the age of consent  would not be included in this.

CMV: Flying any form of Confederate Battle Flag or remembering the CSA in any positive light is an incredibly seditious and unpatriotic gesture. It is glorifying the single greatest existential threat to the -United- States of America and its ideals.,"I find the concept of flying any confederate battle flag or CSA national flag to be not only in poor taste  but a seditious action and one of the most unpatriotic displays possible. Far worse than burning the American flag  it is glorifying the bloodiest and most existential threat the USA has ever faced  a force that could actually destroy the Union.  People who fly such a flag are  inadvertently or intentionally  damaging the dignity of the USA and the men who died to prevent the destruction of the ideals of the Union.  In effect  its one of the most unpatriotic actions possible short of direct treason or conspiracy. It is a glorification of sedition.

"CMV: If religious people can opt out of a law due to their views, anyone should be allowed to opt out for any reason.","This is inspired by the Hobby Lobby case that granted religiously-motivated corporations the right to opt out of providing birth control  but ~~it~~ **my argument** also applies to other laws from which religious people are exempt such as peyote prohibition.

It's pretty simple: I believe laws should apply equally to everyone. Anything else is unfair.

This is true regardless of how I feel about any particular law. I want all corporations to supply birth control  but since the Supreme Court has ruled that some don't I believe none should. Since the Hobby Lobby decisions applies to corporations  it's now creating unfair competition because religious companies can save money on insurance.

Laws that affect actual people are even more important  because that's discrimination. In the US your right to practice your religion is constitutionally protected  and so is my right to not practice your religion. Yet if I want to take peyote  the federal government has essentially said I must convert to a religion that allows it.

The only exception I've thought of is the tax-exempt status of religious organizations. Personally I don't think they should be exempt at all  but you can probably make a compelling argument in favor. However  they could just be covered by the same laws as non-profits without requiring their own special tax code.

**EDIT** I repeat: this is not an argument about whether the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the correct side in the Hobby Lobby case. I'm simply arguing a general principle.

**EDIT2** Clarified my first paragraph. Never meant to imply the Hobby Lobby ruling has anything to do with peyote.

"CMV: Hilary Clinton's repeated reminders of her womanhood are, perhaps ironically, counter to the feminist philosophy and is the equivalent of ""playing the race card"".","During the debate  Hilary Clinton mentioned the fact that she is a woman and specifically indicated that she is the best candidate solely *because* she is a woman several times tonight.

As someone who identifies as a feminist   I find this condescending and entirely counter productive. That fact that you are a woman no more qualifies you for **any** job than does being a man. The cornerstone of feminism is that a person should be judged not by their sex but by their deeds. By so flippantly using her sex as a qualification for the presidency  Hilary is setting feminism back. 

Further  in 2008  there was strong and very vocal push back to the Obama campaign for ""playing the race card"". Critics  by liberal and conservative  demanded that the Obama campaign never use his race to appeal to voters. Which  at least as far as Obama himself is concerned  led to him literally telling the public not to vote for him only because he is black. 

If at any point Barack Obama *had* said anything akin to what Hilary said tonight  he would have been crucified by the press. The fact that Hilary gets away with this is indicative of an inherent media bias and  once again  is counterproductive to female empowerment. 

I would love to be able to see the value in this tactic but so far I have found none.

Clinton is justified in her use of this tactic  I still feel quite strongly that it is the wrong course of action with respect to achieving **a perfect** civil society.

* It is quite clear that my definition of feminism is/was far too narrow in this context. As has now been pointed out several times  I'm taking an egalitarian stance when the majority of selfproclaimed feminists are part of the so-called second wave movement. This means  I think  that this debate is far more subjective than I originally thought.

* I want to address a criticism that keeps popping up on this thread and that is that Hilary never **literally** said that being a woman is the sole qualification for her candidacy. 

This is inescapably true. 

However  though I know for a fact that some of you disagree  I think it is and was painfully obvious that Sen. Clinton was strongly implying that her womanhood should be  if not the most important factor  certainly the deciding factor in the democratic primary. Every single sentence that comes out of a politician's mouth is laden with subtext. In fact  more often than not  what is implied and/or what is left unsaid is of far more consequence than what *is* said. I would even go so far as to say that this ""subliminal"" messaging is an integral part of modern public service. To say that Hilary's campaign should only be judged based upon what she **literally** says is to willfully ignore the majority of political discourse in this country.

* Finally  thanks everybody!

CMV: Trump has not accomplished anything that his voters/supporters wanted/want.,"Okay  I absolutely hate Trump  but I don't want that to be the point of this post. I'm really seeking to understand the perspective of certain family members who love the guy and think he's doing a great job  but can't seem to list any specific things he's done that they like or that show any real accomplishment at all.

All attempts at a repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act have been very unsuccessful.

Clinton is not in jail.

""Muslim"" bans have been shot down left and right.

The wall *might* be built  but it's still not clear and it certainly don't be done by Christmas. The tax cuts they are proposing make it even less likely there will be money to build the wall.

The ""swamp"" isn't drained. It's still all corporate and wall street guys and wealthy politicians all around. 

So  what exactly has Trump done that makes him successful as a leader/president for his supporters? Nothing as far as I can tell.

CMV: The same arguments that justify gay marriage also justify polygamy,"You typically hear some slippery-slope arguments from the anti-gay marriage side  saying that if we allow gay marriage  we'll also allow pedophilia  beastiality  and polygamy. Now the first two I think are ridiculous. I think we can all agree that marriage needs to be between consenting adults  which dismisses pedophilia and beastiality. However  I cannot think of any reason why polygamy should not be included in the umbrella of marriage given arguments for gay marriage.

I particularly remember an episode of Jon Stewart where he responded to this argument by saying ""people aren't born polygamist"". That just isn't true. The definition of being gay is that you are sexually attracted to people of the same sex. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who *hasn't* found themselves sexually attracted to multiple people at the same time. So why shouldn't a group of three or more consenting adults get the privileges of marriage? Why is 2 the magic number?

***

Edit: Copying one of my comments for visibility

This has been a great discussion. I'm gonna try to sum up what my view was and why it changed:

Part 1 of my view was that if you're ok with a gay relationship  you must be ok with a poly relationship (paraphrasing /u/CJGibson). I still believe this holds true.

Part 2 was that if you're ok with a relationship  you must be ok with that relationship being a legally recognized marriage.

Therefore  if you're ok with gay relationships  you must be ok with polygamous marriage.

My issue was in part 2. A socially accepted relationship does not necessarily mean it should be a legally recognized marriage. As pointed out by /u/tbdabbholm and /u/GnosticGnome and others  the structure of marriage works best with 2 people  from a legal and practical standpoint. We already have this established structure as the institution of marriage. That being said  a relationship between a gay couple should be able to advance to marriage status because they should have the same right to access the benefits of marriage as a straight couple. However  since poly relationships have more than 2 people  they are incompatible with the already established institution of marriage  so it should not be legal.",336,1,4,18,24,"[['schiavo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/terri_schiavo_case)'], ['bonding](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/busting-myths-about-human-nature/201205/marriage-and-pair-bonds)'], ['http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2016/04/16666/'], ['http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/08/523020895/a-baby-with-3-genetic-parents-seems-healthy-but-questions-remain'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['context.](http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6039&context=law_lawreview&sei-redir=1)'], ['https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120124093142.htm'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['that](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success).'], ['http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/14/opinion/china-challenges-one-child-brooks/index.html'], ['pdfs', 'monogamy](http://14.139.206.50:8080/jspui/bitstream/1/1105/1/barash&lipton%20-%20the%20myth%20of%20monogamy%c2%9d.pdf)', 'nature](https://teoriaevolutiva.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/agustc3adn-fuentes-race-monogamy-and-other-lies-they-told-you_-busting-myths-about-human-nature-university-of-california-press-2012-2.pdf)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[source](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_318.30.asp?current=yes),'], ['across](http://www.queenanlaw.com/blog/much-pay-child-support-multiple-children/)'], ['well-being](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2930824/)', 'table](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2930824/table/t3/),'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['papers](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/19573/7/19573%20alsharfi%20pfeffer%20miller%202015.pdf),', 'world](http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1898&context=student_scholarship)', 'cultures](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3773961?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)', 'known](https://goodmenproject.com/families/impact-of-a-polygamous-marriage-on-children-and-family-wcz/)']]",0,112,1,Yes
"I believe that reactionary responses to terrorist acts e.g. no bags at 2014 Boston Marathon are unnecessary, mostly ineffective and send a message that terrorism is effective. CMV","I'm a lifelong resident of Massachusetts living in the Boston area. Last March  the Boston Marathon was the target of terrorist act that left more than 200 injured and 3 dead. This year  the announcement was made that there would be no bags allowed into certain areas along the route and runners would not be allowed to keep bags at the finish line  nor carry them on their person. This notably hamstrung the efforts of service members planning the yearly Tough Ruck  where they carry the packs of fallen soldiers for the entire marathon.

Hearing this news  I immediately thought  do the organizers not realize that they are doing the exact thing that the horrible individuals that perpetrate these acts want them to do? They want us to always be in fear  to associate fear with them.  Wouldn't a better response be for all of us to recognize that we live in a free society  but that freedom comes with a price  often the highest price of all. To proudly continue our tradition in the face of those who would attempt to sow fear and chaos. It sends a message that we are strong  enriched by the rational conclusion that  while we will never be 100% safe  we can be 100% free. But to sacrifice that  for some perceived security  is folly. Change my view.

I want to qualify that I was extremely lucky to not be personally impacted by the events of last year. I feel sadness for every family irreparably changed by that day  and I can't imagine what they had to go through. I would be especially interested in the view of those that have been more deeply/personally affected by this and other tragedies if that informed your viewpoint.

"CMV: Just as hetero men are ""held responsible"" for women's body image issues, hetero women should be ""held responsible"" for men's self-destructive and macho behaviour","First up  I'm not suggesting any kind of legal or otherwise tangible accountability.  I mean within the discourse  women's romantic preferences should be acknowledged as a contributing factor to the problem of men's macho behaviour.

Basically  it seems to me that in discussions about the female body image crisis men's sexual preferences for skinny and unrealistic female bodies are named as a contributing factor.

It seems to me that the reasoning goes something like: ""Women are starving themselves because they think (rightly or wrongly) that that's what men want""

Well  it seems to me that men are suffering in another area of life due to their perception of what women want: road traffic deaths/injuries.

The [World Health Organisation states](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs358/en/) that:

>From a young age  males are more likely to be involved in road traffic crashes than females. About three-quarters (73%) of all road traffic deaths occur among men. Among young drivers  young males under the age of 25 years are almost 3 times as likely to be killed in a car crash as young females.

I don't think it's controversial to deduce that driving dangerously is usually an act of bravado which in itself is a manifestation of the ""macho"" culture that many young men consider is essential to making themselves appealing to the opposite sex.

Potential counterarguments:

* **""Well  women aren't actually impressed by or attracted to aggressive or macho behaviour""** -- Yeah  well some are.  Just like some men are attracted to skinny girls.  But the problem is that each gender has a warped sense of what the other wants.  So if women's misguided belief that they need to look a certain way is pinned on men  then men's misguided belief that they need to *behave* a certain way should be pinned on ~~men~~ women.

* **""Women aren't starving themselves for men  they're chasing body image ideals to impress other women""** -- I've never bought this argument (which I've also seen deployed in discussions about why women wear make-up  expensive clothes etc).  Sure  maybe consciously a lot of women want to look ""good"" to impress other women.  But I would argue that their entire conception of ""what looks good"" and ""what is feminine"" is intrinsically informed by what men find attractive.  Similarly with why men drive fast and generally act like macho idiots.  A group of lads might be hooning around the streets of your local town on a Saturday night without a woman in the car to impress  but the driver is displaying braggadocio to the other men in order to establish himself as the dominant member of the group.  His method of attempting to display dominance (aggressive driving  macho behaviour) is informed by what he thinks is appealing to women.

So what do I want?

As I said in the first paragraph  I'm not saying we should scorn women for this in any tangible way.  I'm simply saying that it should be acknowledged as a part of the problem of young male aggression in the way that male sexual preferences are frequently identified as a part of the body image problem among women.  In recent years  I think many men would have experienced a backlash from ""female-body-ideal-non-conforming"" women when commenting on the attractiveness of a 
""female-body-ideal-**conforming**"" woman.  

Women who express attraction to or admiration for men engaging in dangerous macho behaviour should face the same public disapproval in the same way that men who like ""skinny"" women do.

Just as men are being ""educated"" through the public discourse on embracing ""real women"" (ie with curves and ""female-body-ideal-non-conforming"" body types)  women should be ""educated"" through public discourse on embracing men who display ""male-behavioural-ideal-non-conforming"" behaviours.

CMV: I believe that Children should be given mandatory vaccinations if their body is labeled as healthy enough to do so.,"To go into more detail  I am of the belief that vaccinations should not be the parents choice for their children  but rather should be mandatory. The only reason a child should not be immunized is if such immunization would be harmful to the child's body due to pre-existing medical conditions. The safety of the children and the safety of their peers and the public should be put ahead of the self-righteous anti-vaxxers. I am also under the impression (and admittedly  probably will remain so) that the science on vaccinations and their positive effects outweigh any negative effects. 

I am open to discussion  but please do be disciplined enough to cite some form of scientific journals or studies  if you bother mentioning medical effects and side-effects of vaccinations  such as seizures.

I think its about time America got over 9/11.

I understand grieving if you lost someone  or if you were in close proximity of what happened  etc etc.

We've found and killed the man who was leading the party responsible for it. We've decimated a good chunk of their organization. We've spent trillions on a war against terror. Its time to stop and get on with our lives. No more halftime tributes  no more mass vigils  no more showing footage of crying mourners.

"CMV: Laws restricting the sale of alcohol, dancing, etc. on Easter have no place in a modern secular country","Pretty much says it in the title.  Right now  I'm in Australia  an ostensibly 21st century secular country  unable to go out for a drink with my friends because it's Good Friday  and state law says that I'm apparently legally required to observe it to some degree.  Such laws are common in otherwise secular countries  perhaps most famously the *tanzverbot* in Germany.

When it comes to special laws on Sunday  I disagree  but I do see the rationale in providing for laws for a common weekly day of rest  and Sunday is as good as any other.  However  when it comes to Easter  there is no rationale other than trying to forcibly impose Christian observances on the wider population  and this has no place in a secular country.  CMV

CMV: Liberal Americans are justified to be angry with Trump supporters and to worry about the future,"Since the election  there's been various statistics showing that liberals are more pessimistic about the country's future and dislike Trump and many of his supporters. Since the shooting last month (iirc)  it's become popular (and easy) to say that liberals should be nicer and more open minded but I believe they would be naive not to worry about Republicans and very passive not to be angry with Republican voters.

Firstly  Republicans have disproportionately high political power. Due to them living in smaller States and rural areas  their votes matter more than those in cities and states like California or New York in the Senate and presidential elections. This means they can impose their ideas on the majority of people even if they are unpopular among the majority (e.g. Trump). This is undemocratic and worrying given their behaviour.

Second  Republicans policies and politicians are genuinely dangerous. Republican policies on health care and government support will almost certainly hurt people and even cost lives. Most political parties wouldn't consider policies as extreme as theirs but they are special in how far right wing they are. Their indifference to climate change  poverty  poor healthcare and inequality means that their policies will actually make America and the world worse. It'd be stupid for liberals to be ok with this. Plus despite Obamacare disproportionately helping Trump supporters  they still want it dismantled just because they see it as a 'win'. How can you not fear someone who hates you so much  they're willing to suffer just to 'beat' you?

Also  Trump and many other Republican politicians show erratic and/or ammoral behaviour that should be concerning to people. Even mainstream Republicans like McConnel regularly behave appallingly.

Thirdly  Republicans cannot be reasoned with. As can be seen by their contempt for higher education  the CBO  media  science and economics  Republicans don't see truth as objective. They believe it is simply a matter of opinion and anyone or anything which says they're wrong must be biased because there's no way they can actually be wrong. Because of this Republicans will enact policies that are dangerous without any concern for the consequences for the future or even themselves. This erratic behaviour makes them frustrating at best and dangers to themselves and others at worst. Simply put  Republicans could do pretty much anything despite how crazy and stupid it seems. In many ways  Trump personifies the GOP better than John McCain or Mitt Romney ever could because of his combination of ignorance and arrogance.

Finally  they lack respect and compassion for others. As can be seen from policies like gerrymandering and voter suppression  tactics like the obstruction from the GOP on things like the Supreme Court and just their general behaviour like the nomination of Trump who is basically a prejudiced bully  Republicans seem more motivated by a need to beat liberals and to control America than any desire for self improvement or any moral concerns. Their indifference to problems like racism  sexism and homophobia should anger liberals. Also their lack of concern for police shootings or sexual assault and their contempt for abortion makes them a genuine danger to women and minorities. Their priority seems to be to preserve a social order in which they have their values imposed on those they view to be inferior (e.g. women  minorities  the poor  LGBT) even if it's at their own expense.

So am I wrong about how bad Republicans are or should liberals not fear them because Republicans will quickly lose power?

"CMV: As a non-american, I see Trump as a total regression for the US and Bernie Sanders the total opposite.","I can't deal with it  I'm trying to use logic but it seems I'm incapable to see why someone who's in his right mind would vote for Donald Trump.

I don't know if there's something about a major lack of education or a really strong wish for going backwards in history in the US. 

From an outsider perspective  this guy represents -at least ideologically- everything that is wrong in human and modern civilization.

Now I'm reading about this Bernie Sanders and his propositions  and I can't understand why anyone with a bit of common-sense and who wants the US to achieve some kind of development as a nation won't vote for him. 

I see that guy as the only option.

EDIT: Whoa! A lot of interesting and insightful answers. I think I have a better picture of these two guys now.

**Trump**: I see Trump's figure is being manipulated strongly by the media  with much of his comments being taken out of context. He's saying a lot of things that many americans want to hear. Apparently there's a difference between his ""show figure"" and his actual positions  which are considered pretty traditionally American by many of you. And a lot of comments refer to Trump's business achievements as something positive  skills that would be reflected in the country if he's elected.

I sense there's a feeling of overall dissatisfaction with Obama  may be helped by the social media. I can't help but think that Trump's biggest strenght is pretty much being a big anti-Obama reaction in many ways: politically  socially and economically.

**Bernie**: Many of you said that you like Bernie's positions and that much of them should be good for the people  but the problem is they're pretty much utopic or unrealistic. Others stated that his vision of the economy would harm America and that the fact that he doesn't have ""real"" achievements in politics or comparing to Trump  in any business at all  is something pretty negative.

The bottom-line as I see it and that it was pointed out by some of you is that both of them are running heavily ideological campaigns  which makes them very similar characters  each in their own way.",476,0,0,33,41,"[['pragmatism](https://lettertosanders.wordpress.com/2016/02/17/open-letter-to-senator-sanders-and-professor-gerald-friedman-from-past-cea-chairs/).'], ['this?](https://pastebin.com/64guvi2f/04180)'], ['sense](https://evaluationoffriedman.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/romer-and-romer-evaluation-of-friedman1.pdf).'], ['https://web.archive.org/web/20060507011645/http://donaldtrump.trumpuniversity.com/default.asp?item=98255'], ['http://www.gallup.com/poll/181160/americans-personal-satisfaction-upswing.aspx', 'http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/12/presidential-job-approval-ratings-from-ike-to-obama/'], ['inequality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpkkqnijnsm)'], ['http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/03/secret-donald-trump-voters-speak-out?cmp=fb_gu'], ['https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions'], ['voted](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/virginia)', '**million**](http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/pst045215/51).'], ['https://humboldtdems.wordpress.com/2015/08/12/if-youre-going-to-rant-about-the-federal-budget-tell-the-truth/'], ['http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31293196', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11433776/quarter-of-british-muslims-sympathise-with-charlie-hebdo-terrorists.html'], ['polarized.](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/)'], ['http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/12/08/donald-trump-muslim-ban-full-interview-part-1-newday.cnn/video/playlists/donald-trump-muslims/'], ['http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11987964/donald-trump-sexism-republican-us-presidential-candidates-gaffes.html'], ['himself](http://truth-out.org/buzzflash/commentary/donald-trump-promises-to-bring-jobs-back-from-china-while-having-his-trump-ties-made-there)?'], ['rescue](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/06/public-debt)'], ['wrong](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/columns/2016/01/26/bernie-sanders-says-he-s-democratic-socialist-here-s-what-means).'], ['people](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11268208/jihadists-in-syria-write-home-to-france-my-ipod-is-broken.-i-want-to-come-back.html)', 'conservatives](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/three-of-cliven-bundys-sons-militia-seize-federal-building-in-oregon/article/2579459)'], ['see](http://imgur.com/loaoynt)'], ['[sauce](http://www.cato.org/blog/high-turnover-among-americas-rich)'], ['http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15691330-12341332'], ['on.](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/10/news/la-heb-drug-development-taxpayers-20110210)'], ['http://abcnews.go.com/politics/donald-trump-admits-gear-made-china-labels/story?id=13472355'], ['of](http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/foxlies.asp).'], ['https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-bernie-pays-for-his-proposals/'], ['https://www.getcoveredamerica.org/calculator/'], ['https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/program-information/downloads/medicaid-and-chip-eligibility-levels-table_hhsize4.pdf'], ['needs](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/order-from-chaos/posts/2015/03/13-geopolitical-importance-transpacific-partnership).'], ['http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/obama-speaks-for-canada-saying-both-countries-will-soon-sign-the-trans-pacific-partnership-agreement'], ['talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson?language=en)'], ['haidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonathan_haidt),', 'religion](http://www.amazon.com/the-righteous-mind-politics-religion/dp/0307455777)', 'article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/),', '[here](http://righteousmind.com/where-microaggressions-really-come-from/).'], ['http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-01312016-htmlstory.html'], ['himself](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/fbis-suicide-letter-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-and-dangers-unchecked-surveillance)', 'today](http://www.itproportal.com/2014/02/26/snowden-leaks-inteliigence-agencies-use-internet-infiltrate-discredit-and-disrupt-activists-and-opponents/).']]",0,131,0,Yes
"CMV: Religious people should not ""pick and choose"" which parts of their religious text they choose to follow/believe if they believe it is the Word of God","To preface this  I was raised Lutheran (Christian) my entire life  but I currently identify as agnostic. My entire family is extremely religious. This view of mine is moreso oriented at Christians  although it could of course expand to other religions. 



To phrase this in the context of Christianity  I find it extremely hypocritical for Christians who  for example  are against gay marriage or think homosexuality is a sin but who have tattoos. Or have had premarital sex. Or are divorced. Or committed adultery. The list goes on. 



There are so many things the Bible says you shouldn't do. I don't feel like Christians can pick and choose which parts of the Bible they would like to follow and which ones are okay to not follow. Sometimes people will say that there's a difference between the Old and New Testaments in belief systems. However  Leviticus 19:19 states that one should not wear clothing woven of different types of material - but Christians have no problem wearing cotton polyester blends or other fabric mixtures. Yet Leviticus 18 and 20 communicates that homosexuality is a sin  and the majority of Christians  while possibly accepting to a gay person  still feel as if gay marriage is unholy. Same book. 



I do understand that there are Christians who support gay marriage  which also confuses me since I feel like in order to have faith and truly believe in your God  that you would also have to believe the *full* word of God (aka the Bible)  not just certain parts. 



Moreover  how can someone believe in certain scientific findings when the Bible clearly contradicts them? For example  the earth is billions of years old  but the Bible says differently. Is the Word of God wrong? If you believe in those scientific facts  then how can you believe in the Bible if it's wrong? 



I guess what I'm ultimately saying is that if one truly *believes* in their God  then they must also fully believe in and abide by the religious text (""words of God"") as well  not just certain parts.

"CMV: You cannot reject parts of the bible and believe others. If you decide what to believe or not believe, it defeats the whole point of a religious dogma.","Two major arguments I have. 

1. In general  rules cannot be selectively followed  or it defeats their purpose. The whole reason rules exist is because humans cannot be trusted to decide for themselves how to behave. But selectively following rules means that humans get to do just that  and rules have no power. So  if people choose to ignore the rule in the bible about [not mixing fabrics](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-11.htm)  then they can justify ignoring rules like don't murder  because of the precedent.

2. The bible is accepted based on faith that the word of God is infallible. If you believe parts of the word of God are false  than you are rejecting the premise that it's infallible  and thus there's no reason to believe in any of it. If you contend that parts of the bible are metaphorical  or were modified from their original text  then you open up the passages that you do believe in to the same criticism.

I'm not trying to be an /r/atheist-esque religious basher  or anything. I'm just genuinely curious how this is reconciled. And I'm very open to the possibility that I'm misunderstanding what 'faith' means  since I've never really had it in my life.

"CMV: I believe emphasizing that ""being gay is born rather than a choice"" is irrelevent and gay rights should be the same no matter if homosexuality is born with, nurtured or chosen.","So simply speaking  I do not think it is wise for gay right organizations to link the (still under debate) idea of innate homosexuality with gay rights. If someone choose to be gay  it should be perfectly ok. An analogy is like someone choose to convert to another religion  and this is totally protected by law.

Even if science proves that homosexuality is a (subconscious) choice rather than born with  it do not change how much rights LGBT can have at all. Now with a strong linkage of innate homosexuality to pro-gay-right  if any evidence came out in the other way  that would be severely detrimental to gay rights. In other words  LGBT groups chained their goals to something that is not solid. They should reduce the emphasize on ""born with""  but more in ""one adult can love another adult  period"".

CMV: A doctor telling their patient that they need to lose weight shouldn't be considered fat shaming.,"I don't believe that anyone should be shamed for their body  but I don't believe that a doctor telling a patient that losing weight will improve their health counts as fat shaming. With the exception of those who are forced into obesity by a health defect I believe obesity completely preventable. Honestly  it seems downright irresponsible that a doctor would not inform someone whose health is hurt by their weight that they need to change something. It's never a bad idea to be sensitive about it  but you can't simply let someone continue to damage their health to avoid hurt feelings.


**EDIT:** Added some examples below.
 

http://jezebel.com/5959682/doctors-are-shitty-to-fat-patients

http://www.xojane.com/healthy/dear-doctors-quit-it-weight-bullying

http://www.xojane.com/healthy/standing-your-doctor-about-fat-shaming


To be clear  I do understand that in some cases a doctor dismissing a patient's symptoms as a result of their weight can lead to serious health issues going ignored and that's definitely not okay  my issue is simply with patients who are told to lose weight (in a clinical  not crude way) taking as shaming. 

**EDIT:** Wow  didn't expect to wake up to this many responses! Going through everyone's comments now!


**EDIT:** My view has been partially changed. While I do still believe that it's the responsibility of a doctor to bring up the subject of your weight if it's significant enough to become a risk to your health  regardless of whether or not it's the main reason for your visit because they are there to look after your health  I've also seen that there's a fundamental flaw with simply telling a patient they need to lose weight without exploring why it is that they're struggling with it to begin with. There's always the possibility it's just down to laziness  but depression  lack of nutritional knowledge  and several other things are more common than I realized as underlying issues. 


As for people feeling shamed and angry because they have other issues which go ignored because they are automatically dismissed as a result of their weight: while I still believe this is a separate issue from my question (as that was about patients feeling shamed simply because it was brought up they could benefit from losing some weight  rather than only mentioning their weight regardless of other issues) this seems to be much more common than I believed. I intend to research more about it  but I assumed as clinically trained professionals it had to be a rare phenomenon. I still think in many of these cases weight management could probably have reduced symptoms or allowed an earlier diagnosis  but clearly it's an issue regardless. I do also see how this could  understandably  but people on the defensive enough about their weight so that even when their issue is addressed  if weight is brought up afterwards or in addition to it  their feelings could be hurt enough that in their mind that was the focus of the visit.

CMV: It is contradictory to be both a Libertarian and be in favor of net neutrality.,"IÕm sure IÕll get hit with a lot of highly technical reasons why IÕm wrong  but IÕm looking for a laymanÕs answer. As I understand it  the only way to ensure net neutrality is by heavy government regulation of ISPs. Comcast and Verizon and all them would have loved to have a non-neutral Internet from the jump  but the government reigned them in.

Libertarians  in theory  want as little government intervention into private business and life as possible. 

So how can a libertarian be in favor of a policy that is *based* on government interference in the private businesses that are ISPs?

CMV!

To be clear  IÕm very in favor of net neutrality. But IÕm also in favor of a lot of government regulations. IÕve just been surprised to see on Reddit that so many people are in favor of net neutrality because I thought a bunch of Redditors were also libertarians. Not that that means no redditors are liberal  but hopefully you all know what I mean!

Edit: Thanks guys! I've replied to a few great answers below. I think I was using a broad view of libertarianism and forgetting that everyone's political philosophies are goals  not practical applications. And apparently since libertarians don't like government sanctioned monopolies  but that's going on anyway in the current system  they'd rather have those monopolies be sanctioned in a way that benefits citizens.

"CMV: It makes no sense that Democrats John Conyers and Al Franken were forced to resign while many (but of course, not all) Republicans still support Blake Farenthold, Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who aren't being cornered with the same zero-tolerance policy.","I'm not condoning Conyers or Franken. What they did is wrong  regardless of how great they were on the legislative front. Nevertheless  I don't understand how anyone -- regardless of their political leanings -- can support someone who clearly engaged in sexual misconduct.
&nbsp;

Trump  for example  infamously stated -- on tape -- that ""You know IÕm automatically attracted to beautiful Ñ I just start kissing them. ItÕs like a magnet. I just kiss. I donÕt even wait. And when youÕre a star  they let you do it. You can do anything...Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."" On top of Trump being accused of sexually harassing women and making lewd comments about their appearances on record  Ivana Trump also accused the president of raping her. 
&nbsp;

Regarding Moore -- Yes  Moore lost the senate race last night  but he was never pressured enough to actually leave the race  as many (again  not all) Republicans supported him. And Moore has been accused of sexual harassing/assaulting several women. According to the New York Daily News  ""A retired Alabama police officer said she was told to keep an eye on Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore back in the 1980s because he was known to harass teenage cheerleaders at local school ballgames...'We were also told to watch him at the ballgames and make sure that he didnÕt hang around the cheerleaders ' Faye said. 'The rumor was that Roy Moore likes young girls ' she added. 'It was not only in our department but at the courthouse  too.'"" 
&nbsp;

Republicans also seem split on whether Farenthold should resign  even though  according to the NYT  ""He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago  paid out an $84 000 settlement  financed by taxpayers  and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation.""
&nbsp;

It seems the only Republican forced to resign among sexual conduct allegations is Trent Franks. Is there something I'm missing? I'm genuinely confused.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

EDIT: First of all  thank you to everyone thus far who has commented and/or discussed this topic with me! I'm learning a lot from this conversation. One issue that's been frequently coming up is proof vs. allegation. A common argument that's been made is that Republicans require proof before relinquishing support  whereas Democrats do not. In Franken's case  there's a photograph of him groping a sleeping woman. The proof is there. But I wonder  if Franken were a Republican  would his party stop backing him? There's also the argument of allegation vs. conviction. While Farenthold wasn't convicted  he did settle a sexual harassment lawsuit with taxpayer money. Doesn't that  to at least SOME extent  factor into proof of the allegation? Someone mentioned that resigning is an admittance of guilt (like in both Conyer's and Franken's case). But isn't settling a lawsuit with money also an admittance of guilt?

CMV: The United States of America is socially and legally backwards and should not be emulated by other countries.,"As the title may imply  I'm not an American. I'm a 24-year-old Dane who finished university last summer and as a result  I am a master of science in computer science (that's a mouthful in English)

My childhood was during the late nineties and through the naughts  and during this time I was brought up with an America-centric worldview  with America as this mythical place where you went to earn a lot of money and live the high life. It was responsible for  quite literally 'the free world'.

But as I got older  I started to see a lot of cracks. The first one came when I heard about your healthcare  about how you could catch a life-threatening disease through no fault of your own and be saddled with crippling bills for the treatment  and when I started hearing reports about how incredibly sick patients went to work because they couldn't afford a doctor  I was quite frankly disgusted. When it dawned on me that doctors are being paid by medicine-producing companies to promote their drugs  I was quite literally horrified.

The second big blow was when it came to education. In Denmark  you get paid if you study full time. It's enough to survive on if you're savvy with your expenses and don't have a bank saved up  about 5800 DKK (790 euro)/month if you're living alone and a university student  but it varies depending on level of education  whether you're living at home (You do still get paid even if you are)  and other factors. It's also not tax-exempt because in the eyes of the government you are employed as a student  which brings it down to about 5000 DKK (670 Euro) after taxes - again  enough to pay rent  electricity  etc  and survive on if you're savvy.
So hearing that students take out ridiculously huge loans  saddling themselves with debt just to get an education so they're competitive in today's world feels absurd and with the [rise of automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)  I do not see this being alleviated in the slightest.

From those two loose threads  the entire fabric that was the well-spun lie about America began to unravel. [John Oliver in particular](https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight) has been providing me with the one depressing story after another  and 

* from the recent election of Trump because of [a system that is long overdue for an overhaul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3wLQz-LgrM)  
* to the fact that Americans apparently view their presidents as important enough to memorize the entire line of 
* ~~to the constant (attempted) infringement of rights which needs the entire world up in arms to prevent (PRISM  SOPA  PIPA to name a few) in the name of earning more money ~~[2]
* ~~to the fact that religion plays such a huge role that there's a lot of people willing to reject the theory of evolution and fight for its abolishment is schools ~~[2]
* to the fact that your prison system is bonkers

lead me to the conclusion that  yes  America is a great place if you have an education and want to earn money  but it's a figurative shithole if you're born to parents who didn't have the foresight to use contraceptive when they couldn't afford you. It is an industrial monster that every so often swallows the lives of people to sustain itself. Great economic production  great social/legal sufferings.

Even now  as I write this  I am an intern at the municipality  have been for a month. I don't get paid from the municipality  but rather by two other social security nets:

* One for the formerly employed  but currently unemployed (because internships don't carry the guarantee of employment at its end  and I am technically formerly employed because I studied - again  studying is a job here in Denmark  a crappy paying one  but it's still a job)[3]  and
* The other a fixed percentage of my apartment rent  literally called 'residential support'.

Together it's roughly 9600 DKK (1300 Euros)/month after taxes  and means that even should I return to being unemployed  I won't have to leave my home - I can even afford clothes  good food  birthday presents  and so on.

I am glad for the support the danish government has given me  and I am more than happy to pay my taxes for that to continue to be the case for the next generation. I feel privileged to be born in Denmark and not the United States of America  and ~~I will continue to vote against any legislation that is inspired by the US of A~~^[1] unless...

You provide a reason to *Change my view*.



[1] as /u/alecbenzer pointed out. [This line of reasoning is stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5s9idm/cmv_the_united_states_of_america_is_socially_and/dddfuoq/)  delta awarded. I stand by the rest of my CMV still  though.

[2]  /u/felixjawesome pointed out that [a reason America might look backwards to me is because of its sheer size](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5s9idm/cmv_the_united_states_of_america_is_socially_and/dddins1/). It's easy for small countries  like Denmark  to make changes on a whim  but America is a behemoth  and changing the course is inheirently harder for larger beings. The important thing to look for is the fact that it *wants* to change  and I see plenty of that.

[3] This is where it gets a little wierd. I'm unemployed despite having an internship  but despite this there are criteria for continuing to get this social support. [Essentially  I have to prove that I am actively working on getting work. The moment I stop looking  the payments stop. Yes  even while I'm in an internship I am still looking for jobs because an internship isn't a job - it's part of the internship rules; they need to give me time  each day  to look for more jobs to apply to.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5s9idm/cmv_the_united_states_of_america_is_socially_and/ddde975/) TL;DR: I'm currently in an internship which means I work full time but am technically unemployed  and thus I am employed and earn my money by looking for jobs.

[Final edit for the day.] I feel the CMV is reaching critical mass. It has definitely blown up in a way I never anticipated! I've tried my best to reason my viewpoint  as have others - my view is changed (not completely turned around  mind. But changed none the less)  and judging by comments and private messages  mine is not the only view that's changed.  But now people are raising the same points using the same graphs  using the same arguments discussed already  so I am going to call it quits for today and get back to sketching out my thoughts for the 25th century on the sketchblock I got for christmas. Thank you all for your stories  thought  debates  and likewise  I will return tomorrow to see if there are new points brought up.

I can go for a walk in the summer and shed my shirt  I can swim shirtless and no one says a word or gets upset in the slightest. 

Now if my wife engaged in the same behavior  then we may end up with police showing up or something for indecency. She is engaging in the same activity  has the same intents and is not being sexual in any way. Then because someone else views her sexually as we walk down the sidewalk she either has to cover up or we can be greeted by officers and possible ticketed. She can't swim at the community owned swimming pool shirtless because of someone else's inability to control themselves  she can't work outside shirtless because of someone else's lack of control over their own feelings. 

It is not my wife's  my daughter's or any other woman's fault that some individuals cannot control their emotions  or actions and sexualize their bodies even when they don't intend to. And a woman's body is not inherently sexual to every one the same as mine is not. A woman showing her breast by lack of covering isn't automatically sending out invitations to every man in the world to get some.

 I don't think a woman is responsible for a man's actions  either men should be required to cover the same. This is maybe an okay idea  I know I see some guys out without shirts that to me are way more inappropriate than most women I have seen  add lots of hair and excess body fat to the mix  or each should be allowed to keep their torso exposed.

CMV: Allowing hateful speech is important because hateful people will prove themselves wrong but suppressing their speech will rally people to their cause,"Demanding that people be banned from hateful speech against any group is a bad idea. People are largely childish and want what they're told they can't have. For this reason  banned things always appeal to people  even if it is not good.

However  if hateful people are given free reign to spout their hate  then they will ultimately show themselves unpalatable to the majority of people who just want to live and let live.

As a matter of fact  I personally think that the desire to suppress hate speech is indicative of a worry that there may be too much truth in what the supposedly hateful people are saying.

Personally  I believe that things that might be truly called hate speech are self-defeating  and I think they are wrong. I believe that so much that I trust it to end itself with its own wrongness.

Hate speech is not equal and opposite to morally correct and right ways of thinking. It will not win out if it is given free reign. It can only win when other evils like suppression of free speech come up and make it seem shiny and appealing.

Edit: a clarification. I am talking about the government banning it with criminal or otherwise legal repercussions. I am glad you asked. Businesses  real estate owners  etc. should be able to demand any kind of legal behavior or forbid any kind of (non-otherwise-required) behavior they want in their contractual agreements.

CMV: The left-right political divide is obsolete and detrimental to the society.,"I believe that the divide is the product of an adversarial political system and not an inherent trait of human populations. Masses of people are being ideologically brainwashed to hate the other group for having different means to do good. The heat of the argument makes debating reasonable policies based on data impossible. Politicians can be reelected just by fighting the other group  not presenting any new social ideas. Progress is hampered. Perhaps it would be in everyone's interest to fight the left-right labeling and focus on specific policies and ideas instead of blanket names.

They should also be against allowing infertile people to marry.  I will l not accept the argument here that the person's infertility can be cured - let's assume it cannot  or they are infertile because they had surgery done and don't want kids.

We should not be honoring this greedy  vicious  horrifyingly brutal man with a national holiday.

But we should make Election Day a national holiday  and it's absurd to me that it isn't already.  CMV!  

(I realize Election Day wouldn't be on October 13th  and we'd lose a long weekend if we went the replacement-only route.  But I also think every weekend should be a three day weekend and Americans work too much for no good reason  so that's a whole nother thing.)

"CMV: When children display low intelligence, we should be training them to enter low-income jobs, not preparing them for college like everyone else.","This is for the USA in particular. Fact is  there are too many graduates  and a lot jobs we need don't take graduates. If a kid is three grades behind in reading or refuses to do schoolwork or whatever  yeah they should still get the three R's  but the focus should be things like woodshop  welding  plumbing  circuits  motors  cooking  etc. And for the lowest levels  we should be preparing them for factories  fast food  and retail. My city already does this. For the mentally handicapped  ages 18-21  we train them to get a job and function in society. And it's a hugely successful program.

Not every student needs to learn biology  chemistry  US history  Shakespeare  etc. They weren't going to remember it anyway. Of course there's value in those things  but the **opportunity cost** of not teaching the practical subjects is much higher.

This kind of separation should definitely happen in high school  but maybe even start in middle or late elementary. If we net a student who ends up smart  then they will be one of the best d*** practical engineers of their generation  and the fact that we didn't teach them precalculus won't stop them from learning it if it's needed.

Edit: I found a good article showcasing what I'm talking about in the real world [here](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/02/the-return-of-vocational-high-schools-more-options-or-the-kiss-of-death).

Edit: Fine. Don't base it off intelligence. Base it off some rubric of chronic underperformance  and the recommendation of many  many teachers. Those students who can't easily succeed in traditional school I think could find better success in the vocations  whether it meshes better with their personality or interests or abilities or whatever. It's not so much because they are stupid (be that as it may)  but moreso that they are different. In the reverse  I am sure some students would do poorly in the vocational track  but okay in the college track.

CMV: arguments against universal healthcare also apply to helping people in Houston,"I believe if you don't support universal healthcare  you should be against the government helping flooded people in Houston. Along with my experience of people debating against universal healthcare  I'm also taking this list as a help: https://balancedpolitics.org/universal_health_care.htm

Let's play the devil's advocate here:

* If the government agencies are never efficient  we should let the free market save the flooded and bill the people rescued.

* Cost control of rescue missions will be better if the driving forces of the rescue operations are competition  innovation and profit motives.

* Patients should have a way to choose which treatment they can get according to what they can afford  and it should be the same for people in floods and rescue missions.

* Costs are increased when patients don't curb their doctor visits  and likewise they might not show restraint when asking for help from the rescue missions if they know they won't be billed for it afterwards.

* People who take care of themselves by doing sport  eating well and not living in areas liable to flooding should not have to pay the burden for the others.

* Government is likely to pass regulations against smoking  eating and not evacuating places with a tempest forecast  which will lead to a loss of personal freedoms.

**Clarification**: this looks like a ""double-standard"" question (https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_double_standards)  which are usually disallowed  so let me clarified my stance. I think arguments against universal healthcare don't make any sense and this is perfectly illustrated by natural disasters  as they can also apply but sound completely absurd. I'll consider my view changed if you are able to convince me that this analogy doesn't hold because there are deep and important reasons why saving people in Houston for free is more justified than having universal healthcare  from an anti-universal healthcare perspective. (I'll also consider my view changed if you are somehow able to convince me that we should let the free market save people in Houston.)

CMV: I think the modern-day American working lifestyle is a never-ending cycle of unneeded stress and needs to change.,"I really can only speak as an American citizen who works in corporate from 7-5PM. From what I can tell  and this is not a new sentiment  however daily life for the average middle class working person is monotonous and habitual. You wake up early to go to work; sit in an office where a good chunk of the people are actually just being as minimally productive as they can be to get by  just to go back home on their hour commute. 2-3 hours to yourself only to sleep 8 hours and do it all over again. 

The working culture that I have been a part of makes sense. I can understand that with people that are actually utilizing their work schedules with full productivity and enthusiasm  it's the reason our GDP and economic standing is where it is. However  I know too many people in my office alone that absolutely dread going back to work. Or are stressed out too much. Or just really don't like the system in which we address work here in this country. Of course maybe if they worked doing something they loved it would be different (That's the goal and ideal) however in reality many people don't do what they want.

Just off of the top calculations too. So at least 40 people on my side of the floor have 1 hour+ commute to work. Here is how many hours they spend in their car just commuting in a work year. 

(25 working days per month x 12 months) - 10 vacation days = 290 working days in a year

290 days x 2 commuting hrs (to and from) = 580 hours spent commuting = 24 days commuting  

Meaning people spend a little less than a whole month in their car just driving to work. WTF. Maybe it's a necessary evil in the eyes of a productive company  but shit I don't want to waste 41 months driving in my car until retirement. Fuck.
Not trying to complain. I think we should take a look at how other nations address their workforce and find a happy medium in-between working hard and playing hard. I like the sentiment  however I know too many stressed out coworkers.

edit: I think I've seen articles looking at European countries with a really good work-life balance  however I believe their populations are not comparable to the US' in that they are way smaller. Maybe the US has such a high population that consumer demand drives the work force  however does anyone have a proposal on how to address this?

edit: So I am not alluding to whether I am happy/unhappy at my job; I am just noting on the general mood and concensus of work culture I have had conversations with other co-workers  aquaintances  etc. I am perfectly content with what I am doing right now  however I believe that there's an inherent problem with how society views work here. Anyways  holy shit just came back from moving out my current apartment and I have a lot of things to mull over. Hopefully you guys can CMV.

CMV: Religion is just a schema human beings construct in order to comfort themselves of the inevitable meaninglessness and insignificance of their lives in comparison to the universe.,"I am a person who values the importance of scientific data  logical reasoning  and reputable research in the construction of my world views. I had a conversation with a dear friend of mine who is an extremely dedicated Christian. He informed me that his religion completely changed his life because it provided him with significance  meaning  and fulfillment. I tried to be as respectful as I possibly could when he informed me of his experience  simply because of my opinion about religion and religious individuals. I tried asking him a couple of questions about his faith (Which he was completely open to answering). 

For instance  I asked him about the size of God's influence  and he informed me that it was an influence that transcended the universe. However  I pointed out that the storyline in the Bible is based on the timeline we adhere to on Earth  and how exactly this storyline applies to other planets/civilizations/alien beings. I asked him if other alien species/planets had their own interpretations of the Bible  and if the God they worshipped was the same one that he worshipped. I also asked if other alien planets have their own God  and whether each planet has a God/scripture/teaching assigned to it. He seemed to be stumped by this question  so I wanted to open the floor to Christian/religious folk who had a take on religion's influence on alien species/extraterrestrial life  simply because I do not believe that Earth is the only planet in the universe that has intelligent life forms. If religion is not a schema humans construct to distract themselves of their objective insignificance  but rather a real and truthful fact of life  why is it so difficult to apply it to other alien life forms/other planets/other civilizations?

I have several other points to add to this as well  but I am eager to hear other Redditor's input. 

So: change my view?

EDIT: Wow! Did not expect these many upvotes/comments! Will get back to as many people as I can when I get home today.

"I don't think soldiers deserve so much respect and praise for what is, essentially, mercenary work with an added nationalistic motivation. CMV","I think the way we think of soldiers in the UK (Where I live) and US is old-fashioned  illogical and perpetuates wars. 

Although plenty of soldiers may be good people on a personal level  I think the job itself and the mind set which leads people into a career based on killing (I'm aware soldiers do other things too  but fighting and killing is the fundamental part of the job) are nothing deserving of respect

Although it certainly takes bravery to be a soldier  I don't think that is inherently worthy of respect - robbing a bank  smuggling drugs or suicide bombing also take a lot of bravery. 

In the time we're living in at the moment  I don't think there's any serious legitimacy in the 'they're protecting our country/freedom' argument  since WW2 there's not really been any wars upon which potential invasion has hinged.

"CMV: If charging women more for health insurance for no other reason than they are female is discrimination, then charging men more for car insurance for no other reason than that they are male is also discrimination.","As the new election cycle begins and social and economic are being dicussed  I recall a certain sentiment from the last election. President Obama made some statement along the lines of (keep in mind I'm paraphrasing)""A woman should not have to pay more for health insurance simply because she's a woman.""

Now while I don't disagree with this statement  I do believe it reveals a double standard in society. All other factors being equal  men can pay on average $358 more on car insurance. I understand that statistically men get into more accidents than women. But statistically women also have higher health care costs due to pregnancies  periods  and other issues. So why does the logic only apply to one group?

Furthermore  if hypothetically you were to charge any group of individuals other than men a higher rate of insurance due to statistics  all kinds of human rights activists would be jumping down your throat screaming discrimination. If hypothecially  statistics showed that black people got into accidents more so than whites; insurance companies proceeded to charge blacks more based on that  they would get universally shamed and branded as racist. Same goes for hispanics  women  or any other demographic. So why are men the only demographic that is appropriate to discriminate against based on statistics.

EDIT: A key interesting point I believe has emerged which sets up some interesting dynamics for this debate. The main argument against my view seems to be that health insurance is mandatory while car insurance is not. But I will copy and paste an interesting point made by /u/redbrassdart

I have to disagree that it isn't a necessity  as someone who lives 5 miles from the nearest convenience store and 35 miles from the nearest town where one could find employment. In fact  I have deliberately chosen car payments over health insurance in the past. It is more of a necessity to me.

In a sense  car insurance is a neccesity in order to have any shot at a decent life in the states. If we were debating about Europe or a country with good public transportation that'd be different. And many people have still gone without health insurance. It's not mandatory to the extent that you can go to jail for not having it.

EDIT: A common argument I've seen is that women getting pregnant is somehow not a choice but men driving recklessly is. Here is a good response from/u/dejour

EDIT: First off  I'm amazed and surprised at how fast this thread blew up. I'd like to thank all who participated in this productive debate. As for my opinion  it at first changed because of the most common objection I've seen here: healthcare is mandatory and a neccesity while car insurance us optional. However I have since changed my mind again due to a strong counter-argument which has surfaced towards that  which is  why is discrimination justified just because it's related to something optional? Here is a good analogy provided by another redditor:

Would it be discrimination if Mcdonalds conducted a study that came up with the conclusion that Latinos on average used more napkins and ketchup than other races  and therefore warranted higher prices on their meals? Eating at Mcdonalds isn't a right  it's a ""privalege"" (using the term loosely here). I don't think your argument holds water in this situation.

Another post which ultimately swayed my view back:

For one thing  maybe men drive faster because of more testosterone or other hormones. In which case  the accident difference between men and women is partially physiological.
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1212280/Men-long-ringer-fingers-likely-fast-drivers.html
Secondly  women might use more health care partially because they choose to visit the doctor more frequently.
http://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/centers-for-disease-control-news-120/women-see-doctors-more-than-men-400589.html
""Women go to the doctor more than men  about 33 percent more  and that's after we've excluded visits to medical care for pregnancy. And they are going to the doctors for things that are not acute conditions  such as preventive care or annual visits. They are twice as likely to go to the doctor for non-illness care than men ""
""The most commonly prescribed drugs were non-narcotic analgesics like Tylenol ""

CMV: Illegal immigration is a highly exaggerated issue,"One thing you'll often hear from the right is that they don't hate immigrants  just illegal immigrants. That made me think about what exactly was so terrible about illegal immigrants. Based on what I've read they do not hurt the economy  take unwanted jobs  can't live off of welfare anyways and actually help the economy in the long run. The only semi-valid reason I've heard is that tolerating illegal immigrants is unfair towards those who actually acquire citizenship  but I don't believe a petty reason like that should influence politics. 

First time poster  not sure how I should get across that I'm open to changing this view. Guess I'll briefly mention here that most people from both sides of the political spectrum seem to agree on this issue  leading me to wanting to know why. Perhaps I'm simply ill-informed.

CMV: Libertarianism fails to meaningfully address that government is not the only potential mechanism for tyranny to flourish and thus fails to protect individual liberty in the manner it desires.,"In human societies there are three major power structures at work.

Government- This refers to the state: executive  legislative  and judicial powers. Libertarianism seeks to restrict the potential for tyranny by limiting the powers of the state  placing those powers in the hands of individuals (who in turn can pursue money unrestricted).

Money- this refers to corporations and any profit driven interest. Money becomes analogous with power when the amount of money being generated exceeds the cost of living for that particular individual. Libertarianism is generally guilty of completely ignoring the potential for money to become a form of tyranny. If corporations were  for example  to form monopolies over particular employment opportunities  then individuals would have less liberty to choose from many different companies. If a particular company is the only game in town  they have the right to dictate everything from an employs political beliefs  to their manner of appearance and dress  and how they conduct themselves outside of work. They are also able to pay lower wages than the employee deserves. Employees become wage slaves under a libertarian economic system (and this is indeed exactly what happened during the industrial revolution until Uncle Sam began to crack down on abusive business practices). Currently  economic regulations prevent this from happening entirely and while many employers still police the personal lives of their employees the effect is mitigated substantially by the fact that employees generally have the choice to work for another company. Companies who cannot keep good employees are more likely to fail and so there is an incentive created to not behave tyrannically towards employees.

People- Individuals have power through numbers  social inclusion  social exclusion  and stigmatization. People in great enough numbers have massive influence on social climates which has immense bearing on an individual's personal freedoms. If you ask a member of a GSM (gender/sexual minority) who makes their lives the most difficult and who restricts their freedom the most  they won't tell you that it's Uncle Sam. It's individual people. It's prejudiced employers who refuse to hire them  businesses who refuse to serve them because of who or what they are  and harassment in the public sphere which pushes them out of public spaces. Libertarianism fails to adequately protect minorities from abusive social climates. It fails to protect people exercising individual liberties (such as drug use  for example) from being pushed out of society.

tl;dr so in summation  despite the fact that I am a social libertarian (I believe in a great deal of far left radical personal freedoms) I believe that libertarianism in practice is actually potentially dangerous to liberty. I won't vote for a libertarian candidate despite agreeing with a great deal of their social ideals because I believe that their means of achieving those ideals allow tyranny to flourish. I believe that the most personal liberty is achieved when People  Money  and Government are all keeping each other in check.

CMV: Change.org is a completely worthless website and the petitions will never change anything.,"For the unititiated  change.org is a website where people write petitions to pressure companies into doing something. This can be something totally innocuous  like asking a company to hire a certain actor to play a role  or political  asking someone to step down from their job or asking a company to change their stance on something.

The problem is  no companies give a shit. I've never seen evidence that a change.org petition has changed anything ever. In fact  whenever something does change  companies often make statements that the petition had nothing to do with the change. Therefore  change.org is completely worthless.

As an aside  once you sign a petition  they bombard your email with new petitions to sign every week  which is annoying.

CMV: Sexual harassment allegations with little or no tangible proof should not be publicized.,"For the sake of my sanity I believe every allegation of sexual harassment and sympathize with the victims. Also  I am not speaking about one specific case. 

I think society should embrace the importance of evidence before allowing public accusations. 

I believe our social climate has changed so much to allow victims (genuine or fake) to publicize accusations without any tangible proof and/or consequences. These accusations have the potential to negatively affect a career or reputation regardless of the authenticity of the claims. If the person with the claim against them believes it never happens they have the potential of looking poorly because they are fighting the victim.

***One last thing***
I also feel like the easiest way for celebrities to avoid completely ruining their career is to apologize regardless of if they actually did anything. If a celebrity chooses to fight allegations they have the potential to look like victim shamer.

"CMV: If a woman gives consent while drunk, she still gave consent","If someone has sex with a girl while she is super drunk I don't think the woman should have any legal basis for claiming rape  as long as she gave consent. Obviously  if she was unintentionally drugged or unconscious it would be rape; however  if she chose to get too drunk and made a bad decision that is no one's fault but her own. I'm not arguing that it is right to have sex with someone who is extremely drunk but  consent is consent and people are accountable for their actions regardless of what drug they are on. If someone gets super drunk and rapes a girl then he is responsible (he still raped her) and if someone gets super drunk and gives consent then they are responsible (they still gave consent).

"CMV: If a student physically attacks another student and the victim fights back, the victim should not be punished.","This is a controversy in many schools in the US. One student will physically attack another student  and when that student fight back  they're punished alongside the assailant. This is not even vaguely fair at all. Why should the person who got attacked be punished alongside the person who actually attacked them first? 

This tells students it's not okay to defend yourself  and if you do you're just as guilty as the bully. That's a bad message to send to children at that age. They should not be punished merely for defending themselves.

"CMV: ""White privilege"" gives nowhere near the advantages as money, family status and connections do.","I don't deny that being a minority gives people some disadvantages and that there are still stereotypes and discrimination floating around. However  in recent times we have really done a lot to battle those things and I think people in America for the most part don't discriminate based on race.

What I think is really going on when people spout about""white privilege"" is the middle class and up that has more money  more status and more connections that make life a whole lot easier. 

I really don't think you'd find a significant difference in advantages between an upper middle class white family and an upper middle class black family.

In my opinion  people only say white privilege because the middle class is mostly white. In America  minority communities are usually poor and live in inner cities. That itself is a huge problem and has been a problem forever.

I think that if a white person grew in a poor inner city neighborhood  they would have hardly any  if at all  advantages over a black person in that same area.

I believe the real problem is wealth and connections and not skin color. I also think this talk of white privilege just misses the point and doesn't address the real problem of income inequality.

CMV: Letting a fetus with an incurable disease live is morally equivalent to giving an incurable disease to a healthy child,"There are currently numerous methods of identifying incurable diseases in fetuses. However we still have many parents who choose to keep the child even though they know perfectly well it will never be a healthy member of society. I'm talking about stuff like Down's disease  anencephaly  missing limbs  muscular dystrophy  etc.

I believe that people who choose to keep a sick fetus should be punished in the same way as we would punish someone inflicting a disease on a healthy child. Here's my rationale:

1) The 'default' state of being is 'non-existence'  let's rank it at 0. 

2) Healthy individuals are on a scale between 0 and 1: some are better off  some are worse off  but most have a good life overall.

3) Extremely sick individuals are somewhere between 0 and -1: the diseases cause immense pain and suffering to the kid and the poor soul will never have a normal life.

By giving birth to someone in the third category you're moving a human being from 0 to a negative state  rather than giving birth to a healthy child and moving a soul from 0 to a positive state. If instead of getting abortion and trying again for a healthy child (or adopting) you choose to keep the baby  you have made an action equivalent to inflicting disease upon a healthy child.

CMV: Calling the media the enemy of the American people is a way to eliminate checks and balances at a governmental level and creates corruption,"Trump came out recently as stating that the media is the enemy of the people. The media is one of the things that can check the President - it's a first amendment right. By being anti-media as the president of the United States  at least to the extent of the media that is actively against you  you are attempting to remove one of the checks and balances that allows for you to do your job. Trump is attempting to eliminate all media that is against him so the American people won't see his current and past mistakes both in office  and before. He's attempting to establish power by removing any negative notions of himself  that's corrupt. Removing that check means you have more leeway to do whatever you want.

"CMV: Non-binary genders make no sense unless you accept that gender stereotypes, roles and the like are real and should be so. Non-binary genders, therefore, enforce gender roles.","**Edit** I think we are done here. Thanks  everyone. <3

**Edit2** I'm disabling inbox replies for this thread  as I'm getting so many of them still. My view has been changed. Once again  thank you.
______

I'll start this off with some context about myself and my views on things related to this  as I believe they will be important to this  along with the reason I want to change my view on this.

I'm 16 and I identify as a transgirl  as that is what I feel like is the best match for me. I don't group transgender identities with non-binary ones because I see transgender being at its core about the body  while non-binary identities are mostly social. My view on gender roles (stereotypes  expectations  roles and whatever else will be grouped into one to save time) is that they should not exist  as they limit people based on something they can't change (again to save time  transgender is purely physical  ignoring the social factor since it differs between trans people). So the argument about gender roles in-fact being real after all is irrelevant.

The reason I want to change my view is that because of my identity  I'm affiliated a lot with the LGBT+ community. Naturally  there are a lot of non-binary people there  and I feel like by seeing their identity is invalid makes me no better than the people invalidating homosexuality or trans people. That is why I'm here to try and change my view.

**The argument**

To get to the bottom of this we need to divide non-binary identities into two groups: ""third-genders"" (people saying they are not men or women but instead a whole new gender. These are a lot rarer I find) and ""non-genders"" (This includes agender  meaning lack of gender  and fluid & bi-genders  feeling both man and woman at the same time or one or the other from time to time. Also people simply saying they are non-binary).

The argument for ""third-genders"" is easier. They don't have any physical standard. They are purely based on behavior. Defining gender by behavior (let's say that it includes clothing  interests etc.) is what creates a stereotype for it. Creating genders purely based on behavior is essentially just another box which to shove people into based on their personality. I don't see what's preventing someone from telling a person  who let's say is gender A  that they aren't behaving like gender A. That they are behaving more like gender C  and that means they either need to start behaving like gender A or otherwise they are gender C. I hope this isn't too confusing.

For ""non-genders"" it's different. They are also  as I see it  based on behavior in a way. It's the lack of gender stereotypical behavior. But it also assumes that gender stereotypes are real and should be that way. My argument against ""non-genders"" isn't as solid  but I still do deeply fail to understand them  and why they exist  unless gender roles are in place.

_____

I feel like I've already offended enough non-binary people by completely misunderstanding the whole thing  so go ahead. Change My View.

"NSW, Australia has introduced a law stating anyone who kills a cop while on duty gets a mandatory life sentence. I don't think the life of a cop is more significant than the life of a civilian. CMV.","Some might argue that because they put their life on the line to protect people  they hold more value. But in that case you could argue that a doctor who saves lives is more valuable than a cop. So why don't you get a mandatory life sentence if you kill a doctor? Why are cops so special? I mean  they're still just a person  just as someone who isn't a cop is a person.

I'm not implying cops are *less* significant. Here's what I think should happen:

Punishment severity depends on crime severity. You shoot someone in cold blood: 20 years. You torture them for several days before shooting them: Life sentence.

Either that  or mandatory life sentence for *any* life you take. I mean  why should you one day get to live your life as you please if you taken away someone else's ability to do so?

CMV: Nobody deserves an afterlife of eternal torture,"While humans are obviously capable of some extremely heinous and anti-social acts  I don't believe there is anything that could be done in this brief life to justify an afterlife of perpetual suffering for eternity. 

First off  the idea of eternity seems just about unimaginable for rather short-lived mortal beings such as ourselves. Eternity is like throwing every grain of sand in a desert into the nearest ocean. When that's done  every rock and then every blade of grass. How can the worst kind of suffering (without even reprieve for sleep) go on in this just-about-unfathomable manner and be justified  even righteous?

Secondly  if there is posthumous torture for the wicked (that's another debate)  would it not be much fairer to just have a period of torture? A foray (punishment fitting the crime type deal  again  for another day) into misery before joining the same non-existence as the rest of living beings.

CMV: Genetically-modified foods are a scientific revolution that will change the world for better. They pose no harm to human health or the environment.,"The use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) will reduce global hunger and make it easier to consume affordable  nutritious foods. Climate change is depleting the amount of arable land  so producers need an economical way to feed the world's growing population. The only solution is genetically modified crops. More [here](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/29/gmo-scientists-could-save-world-hunger-if-we-let-them-334119.html).

According to a 2014 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25184846) by UC Davis: ""These field data sets  representing over 100 billion animals following the introduction of GE crops  did not reveal unfavorable or perturbed trends in livestock health and productivity. No study has revealed any differences in the nutritional profile of animal products derived from GE-fed animals."" Cornell's [Alliance for Science](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/) has reached the same conclusion  saying that GMOs are a perfectly healthy solution for food insecurity. 

The anti-GMO lobby is largely guided by emotional appeal  rather than any type of scientific understanding. The anti-GMO crowd has 0 scientific evidence to hang their hat on. There exist no examples of unbiased  peer-reviewed studies that show GMOs are harmful to humans  animals  or the environment. 

I welcome the use of GMOs on store shelves around the world. I gladly buy these products for my own personal consumption and will continue to do so until any scientific evidence proves the risks outweigh the benefits. Is there any reason to doubt the scientific consensus here? What  if any  reasons are there to to believe GMO consumption is bad?  

Note: This CMV is not about how some companies have a monopoly over GMO patents/seeds (i.e. Monsanto). We all hate Monsanto and I already agree with you on that  so there's no reason to debate how evil Monsanto is.  

**EDIT**: Wow  this really blew up. It's cool to see all of the discussion going on here. I've seen tons of links to scientific studies  university research  etc. I'm very happy to see that many of these claims are backed by real data. That said  I did (somewhat) erroneously award a Æ for the possible rise of ""superweeds"" as a result of increased GMO use. It doesn't seem like superweeds are a problem unique to GMO crops. In fact  superweeds can spring up from any use of herbicides/pesticides. 

On another note  it seems there are 2 big things going on here: (1) any potential environmental problems posed by GMOs really look like problems with modern agricultural techniques - not problems that are solely blamed on GMOs. Problems like decreased biodiversity and superbugs/superweeds are issues that we already face with regular agricultural techniques. GMOs *might* exacerbate the problem  but they aren't the sole cause. In fact  it still seems GMOs could be engineered to ameliorate these problems. (2) There is lots of talk about how GMO crops contribute to increased allergenicity and also the decline of butterfly/honeybee populations. So far  I haven't seen any convincing evidence that backs either of those claims. It's healthy to be skeptical about that possibility  but so far it doesn't seem like there's any scientific evidence to back those claims. 

As a whole  my view hasn't changed much. Many of the problems associated with GMOs are based on speculation of what could happen in theory  rather than what we're actually seeing in practice.

"CMV: The education system of America has been specifically designed, unwittingly or otherwise, to facilitate and maintain the power structure of the wealthy.","EDIT: A delta has been awarded to /u/Corzex for adding nuance to my view. Perhaps the rich are held to a different standard than the poor  but perhaps the difference is not as pronounced as I had thought  or that complicating factors may override the difference in standard  on average.

EDIT: A delta has been awarded to /u/yumyumnom for adding nuance to my view regarding performance on nationally-normed tests (SAT).

END OF EDITS

-----

I would very much like to be wrong on this opinion  or at least find more nuance than I currently hold. Anyway  here it goes:

It is generally known^(citation ^needed) that wealth allows you great access to opportunity. If you are wealthy  you can send your child to the ""best"" primary and secondary schools  in preparation for them to attend the ""best"" colleges. Those colleges have a reputation for their networking  allowing the ""best"" companies/firms/etc to give very competitive opportunities to the ""best""- i.e. graduates of these universities.

Let us see how this works for two case examples: a child from a rich family  and a child from a poor family. (assume that all else is held the same  besides their socioeconomic status.)

The rich can afford to send their children to pre-K  and the poor  on average  cannot. This means that the rich child is already at least a full standard deviation ahead of their poorer counterpart by the time they are both in kindergarten.^[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318654/)[[2]](http://shiftfiles.com/files/190667E_source_2.pdf)

The rich can also afford to invest in music lessons  which has been shown to result in overall positive effects on child self-esteem and self efficacy  as well as better relationships with teachers and parents  which- I would argue- leads to better educational outcomes.^[[3]](http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/2199/1/Creech2011Learning102.pdf) The poor students  however  cannot afford to have music lessons  and so will- on average- not participate in any kind of non-mandatory music program. Poverty is also known to have detrimental effects on school outcomes  both behavioral outcomes and outcomes on standardized tests.^[[4]](http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/ERR/article-full-text-pdf/31F3BFB6129)

We can infer from logic that rich families tend to send their children to schools that are not necessarily their ""neighborhood"" public school. We might even generalize that these families send their children to the ""top  elite"" private schools  or even independent schools which charge outrageous tuition in order to function separately from both state and federal regulations. But  even if we refuse to accept this premise  wealthy families tend to seek each other out and form communities  which concentrates resources for those public (or  in some cases  ""public charter"") schools.^[[5]](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/irpweb/publications/dps/pdfs/dp105695.pdf)

These resources have benefits beyond being able to hire some of the best teachers that are not immediately obvious. They can offer expensive extracurricular activities that other schools cannot  such as fencing  ice hockey  equestrian sports  golf  etc. The rich student may take advantage of these opportunities  while the poor student is denied the opportunity to participate by virtue of their public school even being able to afford such activities. The same goes for offering AP courses.

In addition  the rich student's parents can afford to hire tutors and access extra learning resources for difficult subjects or SAT/ACT/AP test preparation. Many of these tests can also be taken multiple times by wealthy students  because they have the resources to spend on additional retakes. Poorer students may be able to afford such a test only once or twice  and probably will not be able to access prep classes or materials.

All of this is important for what I call the ""resume arms race."" The perception has become that a student must maintain excellent grades (all A's)  and also participate in at least three (sometimes a great deal more!) extracurricular activities  often involving sports (to chase ""student athlete"" scholarships  for example)  in addition to their regimen of test preparation  all in an attempt to ""stand out"" on college admissions. (This is leaving aside the issue nepotism with particularly wealthy parents who can make hefty donations that skew admissions.)

The poor student  by contrast  has very little ability to pad their resume  which severely limits their college education options.

Once the rich student is in one of these selective  elite colleges  they are extremely likely to stay. The Open Education Database shows that the top colleges (Ivies  etc) have graduation rates *in excess of 90%*  and some as high as 95%.^[[6]](http://oedb.org/rankings/graduation-rate/) So  essentially  once the rich kid gets in  they're going to leave with a degree.

This is where those connections I mentioned at the beginning come in. By attending the most selective universities  they have access to elite social networks  which allow for selective internship opportunities  which builds networks  which allows this rich students to move directly into the wealthy end of the workforce as lawyers at famous firms  politicians  business executives  etc. This is especially true for students who only intend on getting the qualifications needed to get eyeballs to look the other way when they join their parents' business and take the reins when it's time to pass the torch.

The poor student  meanwhile  may not have gone to college at all. Less than half of all students who enter college will earn their bachelor's degree.^[[7]](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4740480/Pathways_to_Prosperity_Feb2011-1.pdf) This poor student will likely take on debt that pursuing a degree that they will likely not be able to complete  and therefore have to take a job that will not earn enough to finish paying off this debt in a reasonable time. And this is assuming that the poor student pursues college at all.

It doesn't help that tuition continues to skyrocket as public funding for higher education continues to be cut by state governments across this country  leaving education out of reach for anyone but those who can afford it or ""deserve"" it based on their ""merit.""

Looking at these data  it is near-impossible to me to think that the deck isn't stacked in favor of the wealthy. The entire system seems skewed to prevent those lower on the socioeconomic scale from moving up  which means that social mobility is very low. This means that power passes from rich hands to other rich hands  as there is no incentive for the rich to give up their power over education (by voting for governors/legislators who would increase taxes to help make college more affordable).

Is there a perspective on this issue that I am missing  that might help me see some more nuance to this issue? Am I right to be as cynical and jaded as I am? As an educator  I believe that education should be the great equalizer- that everyone should have to truly learn  and learn how to learn in order to be a fully-independent adult. But everything I've seen suggests that despite my best efforts  the game is already so far stacked against the poor that holding them to a rigorous standard seems unfair.

If you actually read all that  thanks for the effort- I look forward to any responses you would like to offer!

CMV: Obviously single-person-use bathrooms should not be gendered,"I'm not talking about bathrooms with a bunch of stalls or whatnot.  I'm talking about a restroom that looks very much like the bathroom in your house; it has a toilet  a sink (in full view of the toilet)  maybe a mirror etc.  

Many establishments  especially non-chain restaurants  seem to have two bathrooms like this and they're often marked as a ""men's"" and ""women's"" room respectively.  

This is dumb  inefficient  and quite possibly discriminatory (see North Carolina bathroom nonsense).  

It's dumb because only one person goes in the bathroom at a time so there's no shared-space argument to be had there.  I'm expecting to be alone in there and so I better not see anyone else come in while I'm using it  regardless of their gender.

It's inefficient because it means that fully 50% of the time that two random people approach two empty bathrooms one of them has to wait.  

And it's discriminatory because by gendering the bathrooms unnecessarily you're forcing someone to gender identify unnecessarily in order to use one. 

The only arguments I can anticipate in favor of gendering these bathrooms is as follows (and I enumerate them here to indicate that I reject them for the reasons that follow):

1. *Urinals/feminine hygiene products are gross and women/men don't want to see that.*  If we made rules about bathrooms in our society based on ""gross"" there wouldn't be bathrooms at most gas stations and fast food restaurants anymore.  

2. *Women's rooms often have changing tables and men's rooms often don't*.  To which I say ""and that is also stupid.""  Further  most places indicate the presence of a change table with a sign outside the restroom so we don't need to depend on gender norms to tell us where someone can change a diaper.  

3. *It's required by law.* I mean  so was segregation for a while there.  Laws can be changed  especially when they're dumb.

CMV: It is largely irrational for most Americans to be concerned about terrorism,"Between 1995 and 2014  3 264 Americans died to terrorism attacks in the US (according to The University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database) (it's a PDF so just go to [this Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=gtd+us+terror+deaths+fact+sheet) and click on the first link). This means that on average 163 Americans died each year on American soil from terror attacks  or about or about .05 deaths from terror per 100 000 people. This makes terrorism less deadly than car accidents ([10.9 deaths/100 000 people](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/state-by-state-overview))  suicides ([13.3 deaths/100 000](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/))  and numerous other causes of death. Since it is so unlikely to affect/harm the average American  it is therefore very irrational for the average American to be cocerned about terrorism.

CMV: Religious institutions should be taxed like any other corporation.,"People can get away with a lot in the name of religion. And that does not necessary bother me. I am all for the fundamental right of freedom of religion expression.


But religious institutions get away with not paying their fair share of tax. That is wrong  and here are just a few reasons why:

a) Churches finances are frighteningly unaccountable. Even non-profit organizations pay taxes  and are subject to the scrutiny of the IRS (US) / CRA (Canada). 

b) Large religious institutions make billions of dollars in profit every year. The American Catholic church alone makes more than $150 billion dollars a year (1). Archdiocese of Chicago alone reported that its total cash and investments were valued at 2.5 billion last year. These institutions dwarf countless law-abiding  tax-paying corporations. No good reason they should not be taxed equally.

c) If some religions are tax-exempt  they *all* need to be tax exempt. It is fundamentally unjust that the state deems some religions as legitimate  and not others (e.g. atheist groups). All should be treated equal in the eyes of the law. 


Churches should pay taxes just like everybody else.

**Edit 1** : Thanks for the great response! Brand new to Reddit  so this is all a little overwhelming. 

Common Rebuttals Include:

> Churches are charitable. Don't tax them!

Well  so are lots of large [corporations](http://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2014/10/07/10-companies-donating-the-most-through-giving-programs/). Last year Goldman Sachs gave over 262 million to charity. That is not a good reason not to tax them. 

Individuals get tax write offs. I wouldn't be opposed to churches getting tax rebates for charitable activities. But they must pay their fair share of taxes **first**.

> If you tax churches the smaller ones will have to close down.

I don't deny this. But we treat corporations and small businesses the same way. Simply stating the fact that some churches will shut down is not a good reason that they should get away with not paying their fair share in taxes. 

> You're infringing on my freedom of religious expression!

No  I am really not. You still have the same freedom of religious expression. I am not requesting taxation on the expression  rather  the institution. I just don't believe it is fair that institutions legally withhold *billions* from the government just because they hold specific beliefs. 

Believe what you want  but pay your fair share.

**Tl;dr** Large religious institutions get away with not paying their fair share of taxes. That's unfair.

CMV: I think Obama is a good president and will be praised by history.,"Now let me make it clear that I'm arguing from a standard American liberal view. I think Obama has been more true to the principles of liberalism than most modern presidents and despite his flaws  has done a lot.

-Obamacare and pre existing conditions.
-withdrawal from Iraq (I know Bush started this) 
-I think he's pretty good on foreign policy. This situation is complex and he's being careful. More so than Bush. 
-he's doing amazing with Cuba and Iran. 
-overall  he makes us look good to the world and we get respect. People around the world like Obama. 

Also  his personality certainly helps. Even when he does things I disagree with he can be charming  witty  and funny when talking. He's very charismatic and has been great at presenting himself (like the limp hand move he did to Castro to not associate with doing the salute).

CMV: I find it flattering if people from other cultures want to celebrate my culture and use elements of it,"I'm Middle Eastern but I live in Europe. I always found it flattering when people of other cultures  for instance white people  took an interest to my culture. I think that sharing each other's culture is a beautiful way to connect with each other and tear down cultural segregation and develop more understanding between each other.

I don't see the big deal with white people wanting to maybe dress up in traditional clothes from my culture for a costume party for instance. It's a good way for people to learn about other cultures and my forefathers didn't ""invent"" the traditional clothing to be an exclusivity thing. They intended it to make people happy and if it brings joy in people to dress up as other cultures  then I don't see how that is wrong and I would find it flattering that they took an interest in my culture. I just find the whole drama about cultural appropriation to be stupid and cause more segregation between us  which is bad.

CMV: Most religion is a coping mechanism to deal with the inevitability of death.,"There is literally nothing more terrifying than an eternity in the dark abyss of nothing. 

Originally  religion was invented to explain natural phenomena that couldn't be explained yet by science. 

Fast forward to today. Even with an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence to explain nearly every single natural occurrence  people still believe. 

Religion is entirely fear based. ""Follow me and you will never die  don't follow me and you will burn in a lake of fire for all eternity."" This is nothing but a scare tactic instilled in young kids who don't yet have the intellectual capacity to evaluate their surroundings. 

The idea of entering a void of nothingness is much  much less attractive than the idea that when you die you get to ascend into a beautiful heavenly place where there is no suffering or pain.

"CMV:Calling someone a ""racist"" is the fastest way to end the conversation and not change a single mind","This election season has once again shone a light on race and racism  but the more it gets discussed  the more the problem seems intractable - and I think that's because of the language we use and the way the issue is framed. 

Presumption #1: nobody (aside from the actual members of supremacist groups) *thinks* they're a racist.

Presumption #2: calling someone a racist is almost guaranteed to elicit a negative  defensive remark and not engage in any meaningful conversation. 

Presumption #3: saying / believing / doing a thing doesn't automatically change a persona. (I.E. a smart person can do a stupid thing and that doesn't change that they're smart; I go swimming a few times per summer but would hardly call myself a ""swimmer"")

The point of all of this is that I feel we would be much better off if we stopped calling people racists  and instead focus on their racist words  actions  and beliefs as being racist. In other words  separate the people from the problem. 

Imagine Uncle Jerry is at Thanksgiving and makes a racist remark. Are you more likely to get Uncle Jerry to think twice about doing this if you call him a racist  or if you tell him ""you know Uncle Jerry  I know you're not a racist  but that remark you just made *was* pretty racist  and here's why ..."" 

If anyone can change my view  and convince me that calling people racists is the best way to get them to stop from saying and doing racist things or holding racist beliefs  I'm all ears (or eyes  as it were). Thanks!

"CMV: Fewer people should go to 4 year colleges, and standards should be raised","(First let me note that this isn't about costs as a barrier to college  though I will get to that.)

In 1960  45% of recent high school grads went to college  while in 2014 the number had risen to 66%. [Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/business/fewer-us-high-school-graduates-opt-for-college.html). I don't dispute that some good has come from this  but it seems to me that the bad outweighs the good. [**Edit:** That number is for 2- and 4-year degrees. The number for just 4 year degrees is about 1/3 of 18-24 year olds.]

The first problem I see is the increasing trend in ""credentialism "" referring to employers requiring new hires to have certain college degrees regardless of whether the education is actually relevant to the job. The degree is used as a proxy for a certain minimum level of intelligence  and the assumption is that if you didn't go to college then you're either stupid or have some other sort of problem (social  criminal  etc). I'm not entirely against using degrees as a proxy for judging other traits -- my main complaint here is that the degree costs to much in time and money to produce that proxy.

Related to credentialism is the next issue  which I'll call ""signal blurring."" To the extent that we want college degrees to act as some sort of signal (mostly to employers)  increasing the supply of college degrees makes them less useful. If college degrees generally only went to the best and the brightest  then it'd serve as a good indicator that someone was likely a member of the best and brightest. But  if degrees go to both the best and also the mediocre  and if there's very little to distinguish the two groups from each other  then the signal is less useful. (Some schools still carry this prestige signaling  but outside of the very elite universities  the fact that you went to college doesn't seem to mean much.)

A problem I see coming out of signal blurring is that it can make it harder for many talented students to distinguish themselves. If we have 2 schools (call them Ivy and State)  and we rank students from 1-10 (just to keep things simple)  Ivy might only take 9s and 10s  while State takes 7s and 8s. The 1-6s don't go. This means going to State signals that you are at least a 7. If an employer's minimum requirement is a 6  they can safely hire any college grad. But the we decide to expand State  and now it takes 4-8. Combine it with a bit of grade inflation  and employers are taking a big risk if they hire from State. So  signal blurring gives an advantage to the elite schools (which protected their signal)  while hurting the next tier of students. It does help the 4s and 5s  but only to the extent that someone mistakes them for a better students  and that doesn't seem like too great a benefit. The harder it is to distinguish yourself  the more risky it is to hire you  and employers will be less inclined to invest in training their new employees.

Increasing enrollment levels also  I believe  decreases the quality of education. To cope with increasing enrollment  universities have to greatly expand their staff  often taking on huge numbers of part-time adjunct instructors to handle the core curriculum (I'm one of these). While I'm sure there are many intelligent  hard-working  dedicated adjuncts out there  most of us are just not well equipped to do the job. It's largely an issue of time and money. Adjuncting pays shit  and we typically have to work 1-2 other jobs (many adjuncts are teaching 5 courses per semester). We just don't have the time or energy to do our jobs as best that we can. We also don't have time to go to conferences  produce scholarship  or do much professional development. And aside from adjuncts  even within the tenure-track positions  hiring more people will necessarily mean reaching deeper into the talent pool  and lowering the average quality of professors.

Next issue is that many students just aren't ready for a college education. I believe that education is a good in itself  and not just useful if it helps you get a job. But  it often feels like throwing pearls before swine. (Bit of an exaggeration  my teaching isn't quite pearls  and the students aren't so bad as swine  but that's the saying...) In part I don't think high schools are doing a good enough job of preparing students  but it's not just about academics. Increasingly it seems that students need their hands held and take little personal responsibility for themselves. For instance  a common response to my students not knowing if there's a reading for class is to simply not read anything and plead ignorance as an excuse -- in contrast to the much better response to not knowing  which would be to find out. Education is good  but paying $30k a year doesn't guarantee you'll get educated; if a lot of students aren't getting much education then it doesn't really help them to be at college.

Along the same lines  it seems that many students just don't care much about their education  and I think this is likely related to credentialism. Much of the messaging they get about education is that it's just a line you need on your resume to get a good job  and they see their tuition check as buying that credential. There's a very consumerist attitude towards college  and I don't really blame students for having it. But  if college was harder to get into  less necessary to get a decent job  and classes were generally more demanding  I'd expect students to be a lot more involved in what they're learning rather than just waiting to get their degree and head out.

Finally  I'd expect that fewer people in college would bring the price down a bit. Large universities get a ton of administrative bloat (rather than enjoying economies of scale)  state funding would go up on a per capita basis  and endowments/named scholarships/etc would be more effective with a smaller number of students.

To address the skills gap when our ""high tech economy"" doesn't have enough educated workers  I'd expect 2 year colleges and specialized trade schools to carry most of that weight.

So I guess the tl;dr of this is that tightening admissions standards (and performance standards in school) would make degrees more valuable to those that have them  while lessening the stigma of not going for those who don't. While some people will get less education  many of those left out weren't going to get much from it anyways -- meanwhile  those who do go will get a better education than they would have.

"CMV: A robust safety net (i.e. welfare) is better for innovation in society, not worse.","In America  small businesses are often touted as being essential to innovation in society. My argument is that many potential small businesses never come to fruition for fear of failure.

If you have an idea for a business/startup  there is generally a high up-front cost  which you're basically hoping to recoup when your business is successful. However  if your business fails  you will have lost all that money  and at worst  be mired in poverty. This becomes a cost-benefit analysis  where you must weigh the potential benefit of having a successful business (less financial anxiety  better life for you and/or your family) against the cost of failure (poverty for you and/or your family).

Fear of the cost may be preventing countless potential businesses from ever seeing the light of day. However  if you could be more certain that you and your family won't starve or basically ruin the rest of your life  you'd be more willing to pull the trigger. This would increase the pool of new businesses  which would succeed and fail according to market demands  which leads to more overall innovation and benefit for society.

Couple more things to add here:
* Currently  younger people are more incentivized to create businesses  in that they don't have a family to worry about providing for. However  younger people aren't necessarily better at innovation. You could argue that older people have more experience  and therefore may be better at recognizing what ideas will or won't work.
* People who are more rash or less risk-averse are also incentivized to create businesses over their more risk-averse counterparts. However  we have no reason to believe that those who are less risk-averse are more innovative.
* A counterargument to this could be  well everybody will try every dumb idea they can think of if there's no cost. I'm not suggesting we as a society recoup all the money they invest  just that we make sure they don't become homeless or starve. I'm suggesting we lessen the risk  not do away with it.",364,2,2,37,50,"[['https://www.bls.gov/bdm/entrepreneurship/bdm_chart1.png', 'https://relivingmbadays.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/factors-affecting-entrepreneurship-development/'], ['here](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/economy/micro/small-and-medium-enterprises/number/per-capita#2005).'], ['creativity-killer](http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2009/01/creativity.aspx),'], ['ocean](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/30/world/asia/what-china-has-been-building-in-the-south-china-sea.html?_r=0),'], ['think](https://medium.com/@freddiedeboer/the-three-hot-trends-in-silicon-valley-horseshit-95cc5a85e8a4).'], ['[germany](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd.zg?end=2015&locations=de&start=2000)', '[usa](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd.zg?end=2015&locations=us&start=2000)'], ['^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/fcrfs94k/15486)'], ['family.](http://prospect.org/article/cascading-effects-parental-stress)'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_financial_assets_per_capita'], ['index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_innovation_index).', 'index](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_innovation_index),'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['in](https://www.google.se/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/12/21/best-countries-for-business-2016-behind-the-numbers/amp/).'], ['book](https://marianamazzucato.com/entrepreneurial-state/)'], ['https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/the-french-ourselves/'], ['^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/fcrfs94k/15170)'], ['article](https://qz.com/455109/entrepreneurs-dont-have-a-special-gene-for-risk-they-come-from-families-with-money/)'], ['increases](http://www.ducksters.com/money/supply_demand_example2a.gif)', 'rarer](http://www.ducksters.com/money/supply_demand_example1b.gif)'], ['this](https://files.illinoispolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/welfare_report_finalfinal.pdf)'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_financial_assets_per_capita'], ['go](https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/5224.html).', 'huh.](http://money.cnn.com/interactive/economy/minimum-wage-since-1938/images/minimum-wage-ie.png)'], ['^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/fcrfs94k/65604)'], ['ownership.](https://mises.org/library/austrian-theory-environmental-economics)'], ['^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/fcrfs94k/85298)'], ['https://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwpma/9908001.html', 'https://ideas.repec.org/p/iza/izadps/dp3597.html'], ['http://www.businessinsider.com/most-innovative-countries-in-the-world-2016-8'], ['^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/fcrfs94k/45591)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['adult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult).', 'lopsided](http://imgur.com/a/kvgan)', 'money](https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700)', 'cycle](https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_beware_fellow_plutocrats_the_pitchforks_are_coming))', 'economics](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-06-19/the-capitalist-s-case-for-a-15-minimum-wage).'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_intellectual_property_indicators', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-innovative-countries/'], ['low](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/stories/2017/05/09_feus_sos_reports.html)'], ['report](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs396tot.pdf)'], ['income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_income)'], ['index](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-17/sweden-gains-south-korea-reigns-as-world-s-most-innovative-economies).'], ['[wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_minimum_wages_by_country)'], ['^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/fcrfs94k/87726)'], ['http://www.worldfinance.com/home/the-10-most-innovative-countries-in-the-world'], ['bank](http://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty).', 'wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy_of_the_commons).', 'tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigovian_tax)']]",0,108,0,Yes
"[CMV] I think that Men's Rights issues are the result of patriarchy, and the Mens Rights Movement just doesn't understand patriarchy.","Patriarchy is not something men do to women  its a society that holds men as more powerful than women. In such a society  men are tough  capable  providers  and protectors while women are fragile  vulnerable  provided for  and motherly (ie  the main parent). And since women are seen as property of men in a patriarchal society  sex is something men do and something that happens to women (because women lack autonomy). Every Mens Rights issue seems the result of these social expectations.

The trouble with divorces is that the children are much more likely to go to the mother because in a patriarchal society parenting is a woman's role. Also men end up paying ridiculous amounts in alimony because in a patriarchal society men are providers.

Male rape is marginalized and mocked because sex is something a man *does to* a woman  so A- men are supposed to want sex so it must not be that bad and B- being ""taken"" sexually is feminizing because sex is something thats ""taken"" from women according to patriarchy.

Men get drafted and die in wars because men are expected to be protectors and fighters. Casualty rates say ""including X number of women and children"" because men are expected to be protectors and fighters and therefor more expected to die in dangerous situations. 

It's socially acceptable for women to be somewhat masculine/boyish because thats a step up to a more powerful position. It's socially unacceptable for men to be feminine/girlish because thats a step down and femininity correlates with weakness/patheticness.

"CMV: Suicide Hotlines should never hang up on someone for ""Not being suicidal enough"".","I didn't even know that was a thing. First time i heard about it on r/suicidewatch i was like ""Dafuk  Surely that must be an isolated case"" but it seems to be a common post on r/suicidewatch. ""The Suicide Hotline hung up on me""

First of all  who decides who is suicidal enough? Is a 17 year old saying ""I failed school already and nothing can redeem me. When I get to 18 and if nobody will convince me not to  I will commit suicide. I will talk to a suicide hotline"" suicidal enough? Is ""I am going to run away from life and run over a busy road to see if god wants me to live"" suicidal enough. What is the brink? It seems like Suicide Hotlines go by ""If you won't commit suicide in the next 48 hours you aren't suicidal enough"" or even ""If you seem calm through the phone  you aren't suicidal enough."". Why though? There are loads more depressed people than the tiny sliver of ""I will call a suicide hotline and if they don't help i will commit suicide"". Depression can be everything from ""I am stupid and deserve to be punished"" to ""My life is a faliure and i shouldn't expect redemption""  and all of them need help. Believing such extremes is bad practice especially in psychology. Imagine if an Ambulance driver gets to decide who is ""hurt enough"" to use his ambulance. That would never fly. 

Second of all  If anyone is depressed enough to even consider a suicide hotline. Something went badly in their life  and they desperatly need empathy. They probably expect such empathy from a Sucide Hotline. Though they are far from that. And when they hang up on them  they will feel even more unwanted. and in an ironic twist  That might be what will lead them to suicide. That feeling of being unwanted is strong

Thirdly. It treats the people like products. Which is weird for a non-profit (are suicide hotlines non-profits  i wouldn't be surprised if they aren't). It is dehumanizing even for those who are ""suicidal enough""  to have such a dehumanizing  bureaucratic and ""DMV like"" measurement of acceptability. They aren't trying to go on a roller coaster ride  they are trying to save their life. 

Of course  the obvious argument FOR that system is ""we only have a limited number of volunteers"". So why not get more volunteers? Advertise your nonprofit? I think people (outside of social darwinists but they suck) would probably give you an advertising discount. Secondly  Do you really think people are ""My neck is in the noose. I will wait 1 minute for the person to answer and then jump"". If they called in general  they can probably wait a moment. 

I am dealing with mild depression. Very mild. If I wasn't so privileged  with a psychologist and a loving family  that could listen to my mind rambling about how much I suck  and an insurance system that pays for my psychiatrist visits  psychologist visits and antidepressants. The suicide hotline would probably be in muscle memory just like my password or my mother's phone number. If the suicide hotline was that terrible && I wasn't that privileged. I would not be alive right now.   

Edit: Jesus of Nazareth. A lot of people have really strong opinions on suicide hotlines. If only people thought and spoke more about mental illness in general.

"CMV: Police Officers don't target minority neighborhoods but rather are drawn there by the high crime rate, which is likely related to socioeconomic status.","Edit: I'd like to define ""target"" as intentionally patrol  cite  harass  or arrest minorities simply because they are minorities  with no other rationale behind it.

First things first  I'm a brown Hispanic who has lived in a poor  pre-dominantly Hispanic neighborhood for a good portion of my childhood (0-9)with the other half spent living in a working-middle class racially diverse neighborhood(9-18). The immediate area surrounding that second neighborhood is full of poor  majority white neighborhoods who were heavily policed due to the amount of drugs entering/leaving their neighborhoods.

I don't believe the police target minorities but rather are drawn there due to the high amount of crime. In fact  I believe the actual issue that creates crime is poverty. Since minorities are disproportionately represented in poverty levels  they are also disproportionately represented in crime rates  which leads to heavier policing.

My reasoning:
1. The impoverished in the area where I truly grew up were poor  rural whites. Witnessing the heavy policing of their neighborhoods lead me to believe that police either a) target the poor or b) poor people commit more crimes  leading to more patrols.

2. I've worked for the police in the next town over  which was majority black. I was a dispatcher and handled emergency calls. The overwhelming majority of violent calls came from the poorest areas  which also happened to be majority black. Having worked there  I understood it wasn't standard procedure to ""police the blacks "" but most our calls came from the same (poor) neighborhoods  which leads to more patrols  which leads to more interactions with the police.

3. Growing up brown myself in the South  I have never once felt profiled  harassed  or discriminated against because of my skin color. In fact  the majority of my interactions with (white) police officers (even when I was caught with weed...twice) have been civil and led to no arrest. Even when getting pulled over for speeding  I have never been issued a ticket. That being said  I am incredibly respectful to police officers every time I interact with them.

I've been told I live in a bubble and have no idea how bad racism is in this country. Perhaps my perception is skewed because the poor people on my side of town were white?

"CMV: The legal drinking age of 21 is actually detrimental, causing a wave of new alcoholics.","At 21  most people are outside of parental supervision  at college  or (hopefully) living on their own (I know this is an unattainable reality for some Millennials  the perspective is still valid for a large chunk of the populace). 

I believe that it is critical that a youth learn 'the right way' to drink. I know this sounds a little silly to some of you  please reserve judgment until the end of this post. 

I see so many people who just hammer themselves drink after drink until they feel blitzed enough. And as many of you experienced drinkers know  you're usually 1 or 2 drinks over where you want to be when it starts to hit you  if you slam them one after another. 

Most of the time it is a strange peer one-upsmanship contest that nobody wins. 

On the other hand  most of the people that I see that moderate their intake responsibly  slowly ramping up to their 'dancing optimum' where your inhibitions are just weak enough to let you loose  but still around enough to keep you from snorting a line of Finishing Sugar off of the rim of your margarita. 

And in most circumstances  those people that drink responsibly were indoctrinated in the responsibilities of drinking at home by their parents. 

I know its common knowledge that parents may occasionally give their older kids a sip of wine or beer  and most people really don't have an issue with this provided it isn't some whackjob parent buying six-packs for sleepovers. 

On the other hand  when the drinking age was 18  many families I knew made it a point to be around for their newly drinking-legal offspring's first few benders. 

Important lessons were learned in these early years. 

* Pacing
* Quality assessment 
* 'Beer Goggle' resistance

In most similar perspectives  it is the gentle (and sometimes not so gentle) embarrassment of family members (that are trusted) that guide the youth into proper drinking patterns. 

Without that guidance  drinking patterns are based upon personal experience and peer encouragement. 

In the modern-day 21 college frat party culture  there are fewer social controls or mentor structures in place  resulting in a larger number of people who become adults without really having a grasp of consumption moderation. 

I volunteer at a non-profit drug rehab  and I see literally thousands of alcoholics come through our doors every year. I get a chance to hear most of their stories. 

Most of them started young  12-14. And they started hardcore  and never really stopped  and never learned to stop  and never learned why they even would **want** to stop. 

And they never had a chance to have guidance from their family on how not to be stupid in consumption. 

So  I feel that by raising the legal drinking age to 21  and stigmatizing alcohol awareness training from parents  we have created a great swell in the number of alcoholics that need treatment to get their lives back on track.

"I think that crimes committed while acting in a position of power or trust (like a police officer, a school teacher, or an elected official) should be treated much more harshly than otherwise. CMV.","I personally think ""betrayal of trust"" is one of the worst acts a person can commit and should be treated as such. I believe that society as a whole only functions when we can trust those to whom we give power over others  and that misusing that power needs to be protected against by making it clear that there are legal consequences for betraying our trust.

However  from what I've seen it is often the opposite. In many cases it seems to me that being in a position of power or trust acts as a mitigating circumstance  rather than an aggravating one. An example I see often in the news is a police officer committing a crime that would result in a civilian getting several years in jail but his only punishment being the loss of his job. This seems to apply to many positions of power  not just police  but not all. I added teacher as an example of a job where the position isn't a shield  but where increased penalties would be justified.

My personal belief is that committing a crime while acting in your position of power should be a aggravating circumstance  which should ""bump up"" the consequences to the ""next tier"" of the crime. I.e. All else being equal  the penalty for a police officer who commits manslaughter while in uniform should be the same as the penalty for a civilian who commits murder. To be clear  the crime wouldn't be ""bumped up""  only the penalty. Similarly a teacher who commits basic assault on a student should face the same consequences as a regular person who commits aggravated assault. Obviously this wouldn't work in all cases  as not all crimes have ""tiers""  but a similar approach of increased penalties could be used.

The main argument I see against this would be that such penalties could interfere with individuals ability to do their jobs. I.e. if a police officer has to worry about being charged with assault rather than misconduct for going overboard in subduing a suspect that officer might opt to let the suspect get away to protect himself down the road. I don't think this would happen  but even if it did I believe that it would be worth it in the long run as increased trust is a benefit in and of itself. Also  as a teacher myself I would completely okay with a system that treats an crime I commit on the job much more harshly than a crime I commit on my own time.

EDIT: To clarify  this would only be ""when it's to the detriment of someone under your custody/care/purview."" Not all crimes committed while in a position of power. Thanks /u/almondbutter1

EDIT 2: /u/graaahh [has convinced me that higher penalties are not needed  such crimes just need to be prosecuted aggressively and given priority over other  non-betrayal of trust crimes in a legal system.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1zwqb4/i_think_that_crimes_committed_while_acting_in_a/cfxxtg0)",132,2,2,5,5,"[['[this?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/color_(law\\))'], ['http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/oddnews/police-officer-hacks-off-woman%e2%80%99s-hair--gets-fired--with-video--211931635.html'], ['all?](http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/14/shock-verdict-cops-found-not-guilty-of-murder-in-brutal-death-of-kelly-thomas/)'], ['defense?](http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/man-charged-with-killing-burleson-county-deputy-no-billed-by-grand-jury-243993261.html).'], ['[link](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/incarceration_rates_worldwide.gif)']]",0,38,1,Yes
"CMV: The goal of ""Free the Nipple"" should not be to desexualize the female breast and nipple, but to admit they are sexual just not obscene","It seems like with ""Free the Nipple"" and other organizations that want to give women the same rights as men with regards to being legally allowed to be in certain places bare chested you'll hear people try to argue that the female breast is not sexual.  I feel that by promoting such an ideal they are being counter productive when the argument should be that the female breast is not obscene.  I feel that the female breast is inherently sexy in certain context but that doesn't mean that women shouldn't be allowed to be topless in public.  For example  as a straight man if I were to go to the beach and see a beautiful woman sunbathing topless that would be sexy to me.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  Accordingly  for many straight women and gay men  if a handsome fit man is walking around with his shirt off that would be seen as sexy to them.  However in many places it would be illegal or at least frowned upon for the woman to do so while the man can do so without consequence.   Instead of trying to change an entire culture that believe that female breasts are sexy  the focus should be more that something being sexy isn't a horrible  obscene thing that society needs protection from.  What do you guys think?  Am I missing something or should the goal of these groups change from asserting the idea that women's breasts aren't sexual?

Edit:

Great responses so far!  A couple of things I' like to point out.  I see how some people have pointed out that I may have made a semantic error as far as claiming breasts are inherently sexual in certain context.  Perhaps a better wording may have been innately sexual depending on context.  My point being  the genitals are body parts we can all agree are definitely sexual in nature  that's their function after all.  However  in certain contexts they are not sexual.  For example  if a woman's vulva is being touched by a sexual partner then that part is obviously sexual but if the same part is being touched as part of a gynecological exam then that is not a sexual context.  

Additionally  in response to a number of comments that a woman's breasts only serve to feed children  while that is an important biological aspect of the female breast I feel that it it borders on mild sexism as if the only function of a woman's body is to bear  and in the case of breasts  feed children.  Many women do not have children and yet many of these woman still feel that their breasts are a party of their femininity.  So while yes I wholeheartedly agree that breasts serve a biological function as a method of feeding children  and maybe that is the main or most important purpose  I won't agree that that is their only function.

Finally  I have also seen some other comments that have pointed out the fact that depending on the person a number of body parts other than breasts could be seen as sexual.  There are a number of foot fetishists out there who are just as turned on by women's feet as others are breasts.  There's probably neck fetishists  elbow fetish  shoulder fetish and many others.  Hell I haven't looked but there's probably a subreddit for each of those.  That being said  I'm talking about the majority of American society as a whole when I talk about the innate sexuality of the female breast.  I don't have the specific stats  but I'd wager that the portion of men who find the female breast sexy is much larger than those who find the female foot sexy.  Although given the prudishness that our culture often has I'm sure if the numbers were flipped  flip flops would be banned.

The arguments that have change my view so far as those that clarify what is meant by desexualize in as far as groups like Free the Nipple are trying to do.  In some cultures  especially in parts of the Middle East  pretty much all of the female body is so hyper sexualized that women have to be covered head to toe.  In the past in America it wasn't a whole lot better  women were arrested for showing their ankles and so forth.  It seems like we have a spectrum of sexiness that goes from acceptable to not acceptable as far as public display.  Most hetero men would agree that a beautiful woman in a lowcut dress  a tight skirt  or a bikini is sexy and we see that in public all the time.  But we don't see what we'd find in hardcore pornography in public or if we do it's quickly shut down.  If the movement is trying to assert that a bare breast falls much closer to a bikini or skimpy dress than it does hard core porn then I'd definitely agree as oppose to saying it doesn't fall on that spectrum at all.

1. It would appear to me that it is clearly wrong to judge a person in advance based on the physical traits given to them simply by virtue of being born. To my mind this is what would constitute racism proper (race being defined as above). Racism as such  I hold as categorically immoral.

2. Culture (as defined above) consists of attitudes and behaviors associated with social groups. *[edit: wording]* Barring genetic explanations or explanations from psychiatric disorders  it seems like talk about behavior and attitudes in individual people are generally explained from the perspective of the ideas people hold. It seems to stand to reason that if explanations of behavior and attitudes in individuals are explained by ideas held  then Òattitudes and behavior characteristic of a particular social groupÓ would most easily be explained by a commonly held set of ideas.

3. Ideas and behaviors  per se  can and should always be looked at with a critical eye and always open to scrutiny  satire  debate  and criticism. If culture is understood to be a social groupÕs set of common ideas and behaviors  they should be open to the same. I hold this as categorical  and if you want to CMV  this is really the heart of the matter.

4. One of the linguistic ratÕs nests that frequently arise in discussions about these topics is the conflation of race and culture (and therefore ideas) under the umbrella term Òethnicity.Ó Therefore to criticize the culture (i.e. ideas) common to an ethnic group it is implied that you are criticizing the race as well. It seems like this is a rather cheap way to insulate ideas from criticism. Race is inborn  culture is an idea construct. Ideas and behaviors can and should be open to criticism. 

5. John Stewart is not believed to be an asshole when he criticized the ideas and behaviors of Ferguson and New York police officers (social groups with a shared culture). One may say that social groups such as police departments joined voluntarily  but ethnic identity is more tricky. I agree that ideas of identity may be stronger if you are raised in a culture of behavior and ideas  but take the example of a child raised in a destructive cult. It doesnÕt seem right to respect those ideas simply because the grown child has spent all his life with these ideas  it seems like the right thing to do is criticize those ideasÉ and weÕre not thought assholes for doing so. 

Anticipated objections:

- ÒYou have your own cultural biases. When you criticize another culture you are always doing it from your own cultural perspective  and therefore some things that are not better or worse (just culturally different) you may perceive as wrong. How can you be sure youÕre being objective?Ó

*This is the reason why I included the words ÒthoughtfullyÓ and Òin good faithÓ in the headline. Just because itÕs difficult to unsnarl biases does not mean that itÕs impossible for a thoughtful and open minded person to do so. Being open minded does not mean blindly accepting that every cultural difference is morally neutral just because bias is often a problem.*

- When you start criticizing the common culture of a racial or ethnic group it can lead to racism de facto because of confirmation bias or unintentional stereotyping.

*My primary value is truth. If a person understands that confirmation bias and unintentional stereotyping exist  then they are better able to ward them off. A conscientious person  who keeps their cognitive biases in check  should not be accused of racism or bigotry for criticizing ideas because they might lead to racism in the less thoughtful.*

That being said  I look forward to a good conversation. This has been on my mind for a while  especially after all the rancor over the Charlie Hebdo business. IÕve had these thoughts for a while  but lately theyÕve been brought to the forefront. IÕm an open minded person  and It really is possible to CMV. But  IÕve had occasion to think a lot on this from living and working in multiple ethnic communities and countries in my life and as an avid reader of moral philosophy and philosophy of science. You CMVrs better come with some kick-ass arguments if you want a delta :)

So CMV!

[edit:] I've stayed in the thread since about 9:30 this morning  and it's lunchtime. I'm going to go enjoy my weekend  I'll be back a little later this evening or maybe tomorrow morning to read through the rest of your replies.

[edit:] Delta on one specific point:
> You're right. Asshole is a relative term  and I was treating it as an objective term. I should probably have said something like ""doing so is ethical"" rather then saying ""it does not make you an asshole."" Æ

Because inevitably someone who doesn't like what you're saying will think you an asshole  even if it's true.

[edit:] After reading quite a few counterarguments  I feel like I have to appeal to a wider theory of objective ethics to point to the fact that not all behaviors can be considered culturally relative and that there are ways of understanding behaviors of societies and social groups as an outsider. 

I'll first quote a few people in this thread that made my point for me:

I'll quote a few other users that have made this point for me:

ablair24:

>In one culture  its acceptable to once a year kill a child for religious purposes let's say (I just made that up). As an outsider  it would stand that in good faith we would want to save that child. Its a very reasonable and clear choice for us to save the life of such an innocent being. But that completely goes against the sacrificial culture.

>Would you argue that it is OK to save the child?

pat121v:

>To promote human flourishing. That is what makes it ok. People say you cant assess morality empirically and we can never say what is right and what is wrong. I disagree  I argue morality is the study of human flourishing. Whilst the ability to quantify flourishing is not as well understood as other fields there we are still able to establish in general terms where certain acts and beliefs fall on a scale of flourishing.

>For example: A society that believes that their God wants every girl ""to walk in darkness"". To this end  they put out the eyes of every newborn girl.

>It is evident that depriving half the population of their sight does not improve human flourishing.

>So with any action  belief  culture whatever  you can try to establish what is ""good"" (moral) and ""bad"" (immoral) based on it's impact on human flourishing.

>That is why  in my opinion  it is ok to intervene to save the life of the child and why you can criticize cultures that encourage immoral acts without conflating it with racism.

I agree with this  and I don't think you have to be an expert to come to this conclusion. 

I point specifically to John Rawls' [Theory of Justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice)  and specifically his point about approaching ethical problems within a society or group from what he called the [""veil of ignorance""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance). 

I'm sorry if I didn't address your specific post in depth  this has turned into a huge thread...

"CMV: As a hispanic trans woman, I believe trans-inclusionary feminism has become extremely toxic.","My girl told me to post here. This shit is gonna be long as hell  so hold on  cause I got a LOT to say about this shit.

I have been trans for 15 years now  transitioned 4 years ago  I am 39 years old  raised in the Bronx and lived as a prostitute for 6 years until I escaped and went to college.

Basically  I believe the whole entire idea of intersectional feminism  the idea that feminism has to be as inclusive as possible and NO idea can specifically tailor to one specific group  is toxic to feminism as a whole.
I see what yall have been doing on the internet  and some of it seriously pleases me. Don't get me wrong  the base idea of intersectional feminism isn't bad... but its being used entirely the wrong way. Its being used as a way to bully and discriminate  its being used in the same way as girls 10 years ago would have bullied their friends for not being on the latest fashion trend or whatever. 

The best example would be the amount of non-trans people saying that the ""my pussy grabs back"" is trans exclusionary all of the sudden. What the fuck? I talked to my girlfriends about this  none of us thought that made us feel bad. We all been trans for years now  we in the same club and everything. Shit  just because not all women have pussies doesnt mean MOST dont have! I dont mind if yall make some protest shit without us being included in everything  we are less than 1% of the population  it feels so uncomfortable and weird when yall be jumping over bridges just to make us feel welcome. Like yall putting us on some pedestal. We are humans too! we know we different. I have talked to dozens upon dozens of trans women exactly like me and yall really making us hate you. 

The amount of white  cis  college educated girls using actual trans people as some kind of trophy to be thrown around disgusts me  and it disgusts other trans people. I am tired of people USING us to make other people feel 'not as woke' just because we werent damn included in every fucking thing. It sometimes feels like we the outcasts of society  but these popular white girls are tryna tag us along in everything  like trying to include us in every little thing that happens. Do they have any idea how demeaning this bullshit is?

I saw a thing a while ago  it was some facebook group  mostly ages 16-25 and I was scrolling through it... every little thing they posted was ridiculed for not being as inclusive enough for trans people. This one girl called someone 'her' and everyone started going in on how ""ohhh you dont know if she trans or not  edit your post  your making us feel uncomfortable"" i swear to GOD i thought I was trippin. What the fuck is this bullshit. I have never seen such insane sensitivity. If someone calls me a 'he'  and yeah  it happens  i am not gonna cry. I know WHY they called me a he  because sometimes i dont dress like a girl and i can look masculine  and while sometimes it upsets me i dont expect the world over to fucking change to my needs!

I dont mean to be rude  but this is not what trans activism is about. Yall are deadass using us as a trophy to bully and ridicule others because yall wanna see superior and woke.

Half these chicks  and i KNOW this shit is controversial  but half these chicks that say they were trans were not damn trans. I can tell  I know when you doing it for attention and when you actually feel a serious mental change in your brain. This wasn't some gender neutral shit  this was me pulling my hair out day and night because my penis felt so horrible. My brain was literally releasing the wrong hormones  this shit wasn't just mental  it wasnt based around me tryna break gender barriers down because im unique and special  this was PHYSICAL for me. I saw SOO many straight white girls tryna say they were non binary and tryna get included on being trans. But yall wanna say rachel donazel is bad for tryna change herself to be black when she not right? Its the same damn thing.

Trans people won't ever be normal  because guess what  it aint normal! Shit  we know that  lots of us embrace it. We arent sensitive  we are fierce and strong  we dont need to be coddled and sheltered and we dont want EVERY ASPECT of society to change to tailor our needs. The trans community in NYC which has been here since the 80s despises this new wave of bullshit  it makes trans people seem like a fucking thing you can just decide to be one day  AND IT AINT THAT.

Now here comes my 'change my view' part. Can someone explain to me where Im wrong? Can someone just say this shit to me and explain the reasoning? Because what I see here is a bunch of cis straight white girls tryna use us as the latest trend.

TLDR: There is a huge difference between the younger  more sensitive  social media savvy trans-supporting folk who have come out in the past 2~ years demanding the world change for them and to radically change our idea of gender to accommodate trans people. Then there are the rest of trans folks who have been here all along who don't necessarily demand the world change for us because we understand we are a very  very small minority and that we are different from the norm. I think a massive amount of the former is extremely toxic and doesnt necessarily understand the trans community.

"CMV: a significant % of non-voters do not vote because they do not have confidence in any party. Countries should have a 'no confidence' vote in elections if they want to increase turnout, while achieving a better understanding of the public's perception of the political climate.",In New Zealand between the last two elections there was a significant increase in funding pushing for a better voting turnout. For many years now they have made it compulsory to register  however measures such as these seem to be highly ineffective globally at getting an increased turnout in elections  not just NZ. There was less than a 5% increase in voting in the last election despite it being a far more prominent election due to the kim dot com saga. National  our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote  nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader  but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us. We all agreed at the time that if there was a vote that had no significance in the election other than to measure those people who do not believe we have any valid current person running for prime minister we would not only have a higher turnout at the election with little effort  but we'd also have a better idea of what the general perception was on the stability of the political scene. This would help us to build a better political scene long term and involve the voter  ultimately resulting in higher voting turnout at a fraction of the cost or social effort and would result in a better turnout. This would theoretically apply globally too  as in countries such as the US it could be used to show many things  not just the (lack of) confidence in either leader  but also other things. I don't know any hurdles that would stop this from being non viable. Implementation might be a challenge but it could easily be overcome and the benefits would well outweigh the costs and implementation efforts,256,2,2,13,26,"[['candidates""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/none_of_these_candidates)', 'turnout.](http://www.electproject.org/2012g)'], ['isidewith.com'], ['http://colombiareports.com/blank-vote-explained-colombia-biggest-electoral-gamble/', 'http://colombiareports.com/abstention-wins-2014-congressional-elections/'], ['video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzttsif43wy)'], ['[64%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/03/12/the-states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-turnout-in-2012-in-2-charts/),', '[82.8%](http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/documents/voter_turnout_history_general_election.pdf).', 'lower](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/09/23/study-early-voting-associated-with-lower-turnout/)', 'elections](https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/08/will-vote-by-mail-elections-increase-turnout.pdf)', 'turnout](http://www.nonprofitvote.org/documents/2011/02/how-does-vote-by-mail-affect-voters-bergman-et-al.pdf).'], ['video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/institute_for_humane_studies)', 'ones.](http://mediamatters.org/research/progmaj/)'], ['idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oadmi)', 'crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdnshu5v99s)'], ['election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recall_election)'], ['http://www.csmonitor.com/usa/elections/2012/1106/voter-turnout-the-6-states-that-rank-highest-and-why/oregon'], ['[oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746).', 'fec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizens_united_v._fec).'], ['[link](http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/20c-govt.htm)'], ['best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanlon%27s_razor),', '[uninformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skw-0jv9kts)', '[misinformed](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brad-wilmouth/2009/11/18/abc-brings-i-can-see-russia-my-backyard-palin-interview),', 'so](http://www.businessinsider.com/study-watching-fox-news-makes-you-less-informed-than-watching-no-news-at-all-2012-5),', 'well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bl7i-dzy0c)'], ['effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_effect)']]",1,79,2,Yes
CMV: Corporations should not be allowed to donate money to politics.,"This issue is perhaps most contested in American politics (Citizens United v. FEC  etc) but I see no need to limit this discussion to the US. The basic principles should hold true in any democracy. 

I fail to see why a for profit* corporation should be allowed to donate money to political parties  individual politicians  political campaigns or election ads. I have yet to hear a single convincing argument as to why a corporate entity should be allowed to spend money to influence politics  I can't see why allowing this would be in the interest of the electorate  the people  or democracy in general. Neither do I see how prohibiting corporate political donations would be negative to democracy or society. 

I'm usually pretty right wing and I don't believe that corporations are evil  I just fail to see the use of allowing them to influence politics in this manner. I would genuinely like to have this view challenged and even changed  I'm sure there are good arguments out there that I have failed to consider. Feel free to ask if there is anything about my position that you would like me to clarify  writing succinctly and comprehensively is always a challenge. 

*Clarified in order to make sure that people understand I'm not talking about labour unions  non profit organisations  political parties or anything else that is not a for profit corporation. Attack the argument at its strongest.

CMV: I was born in 1979. I do't believe there has been a single war in my lifetime that was fought to protect my freedom.,"Fairly simple premise. I'm 35 years old. I remember the Cold War. The first Gulf War. The Iraq War. War in Afghanistan  etc...

I hear talk all the time about how soldiers are protecting our freedom and I swear I'm not being rhetorical when I say  ""Has any war fought in my lifetime protected my freedom or me and my family?""

I have a huge respect for our military men and women. Regardless of why they're sent into battle  I believe that they deserve my respect. I want to respect the REASONS they are sent into battle  but with the knowledge I have  I just can't. I believe we use our military to protect the US's oil interests and quite honestly  there's a lot of money to be made in the private sector selling war machines and munitions.

Please. Please  for the sake of my sanity  change my view.

"CMV: If Trump is proven to be, in effect, a Russian agent, he will remain as President","By 'Russian agent' in this sense I mean someone who offered assistance to Russia in exchange for help winning the election. Even if that is proven  I believe he will remain as US president. This stems from two things:

Firstly  most Republican politicians care about two things: cutting taxes and regulations. Most other issues at best serves as means to the two above ends. Many of them do not seem to hugely respect Trump anyway but pretend to do so to pursue their two main goals. A minority do fervently believe in him but they have many unusual views (e.g. that Sharia law is an imminent threat) that will cause them to largely ignore any wrong doing by Trump. No colloaboration between Trump and Russia will convince a significant enough number of Republican politicians to attempt to remove him especially given the following point.

Secondly  Trump supporters will reject any information that makes Trump look poorly and will either refuse to believe it  retroactively justify it or both. No amount of evidence will convince a significant enough number of his supporters to turn on him.

"CMV: Though the Left may be exaggerating a tad, people have every right to be upset and alarmed that Trump is President, and his appointments are further reinforcing that.","There have been efforts by some lately to normalize Trump  and hand-in-hand with this is the idea that the Left is blowing things out of proportion. That Trump is not someone we should be wary of or question. Essentially  that the whole image of him as racist  sexist  xenophobic  etc was crafted by the liberal media. That these ""-ists"" that people are throwing out have no basis in reality and are just buzzwords. But folks that are saying things like ""Trump is a racist"" are basing these accusations on things that Trump has literally said or done  either on camera or in well-documented cases from his past. Examples include failing to disavow the KKK  insulting Khizr's Khan's parents  suggesting that Gonzalo Curiel to be a judge is unfit because he's Mexican  not renting to black people. The list goes on and on. Every week  it seemed  there was another incredibly unpresidential or borderline facist thing he had to say.

The crux of my CMV is this: Donald Trump is not a normal president-elect  and the efforts of some on the Right to normalize him and say that all the Left's complaints are baseless are mindblowing and ill-conceived.

Donald Trump is  objectively  the least qualified president-elect in American history  and he brought an unprecedentedly low level of discourse to center stage  mocking the handicapped  bragging about sexual assault  bragging about avoiding taxes  suggesting someone kill Hillary  praising Putin  etc. People are not protesting because a Republican won and a Democrat lost. People are protesting because a man with no political experience and little to no political knowledge who openly disparaged entire groups of people has won.

I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here with another Trump post. The reality is  he is our president for better or worse. But I cannot stand the folks on the Right that are saying Dems are being cry babies or blowing things out of proportion. No. When you're surrounding yourself with Steve Bannon  climate change deniers  lobbyists  and hedge fund managers (drain the swamp  you say?) and your rhetoric throughout the entirety of your campaign was one of antagonism and divisiveness  people have every right to be concerned and upset - even afraid.

In my opinion  Trump has lowered the bar tremendously. I think it's important to remember that he is *not* a traditional president or someone we should normalize. That his statements *should* be scrutinized and not forgotten. The whole ""oh  don't worry about it"" attitude is ignoring the fact that people's fears -- if not slightly overblown -- are largely based in reality.

I think this marks a potential turning point in American history  and I do not think that's an exaggeration. I wish Trump the best  but I would pretty much bet money that his presidency will be a train wreck. Tweeting conspiratorial things  saying he ""Googled the Affordable Care Act"" (suggesting he hadn't read it previously)  appointing people like Bannon  throwing around the idea of a Muslim registry. He has given every indication that he is unfit  regressive  and potentially a danger.

CMV: It should be illegal for American companies to outsource to factories with conditions that would be illegal in America,"The reason we created laws for working conditions is that we realize that it's unethical to force people to work in dangerous conditions for overlong hours for low compensation. We see how bad child labor is. Why should only our citizens get these rights if we can help it. It seems to me that the only reason we don't do this is that our things will cost more. But we can't put a price on people's lives and wellbeing.

The subject's complicated  but I believe it would incentivize creating American jobs. Because there would be the same standards  costs would be similar  and America with the lower transportation costs would seem like a better option. We will also make more money off the taxes. Money isn't the main reason  but it is a benefit.

Edit: I guess I more meant that the American companies should pay for the upgrades

CMV: Transgender women should not be allowed to compete in women's sports,"(At least not at the collegiate or professional level)

My younger brother and I were listening to a story on the radio regarding a controversy concerning a transgender high school student not being allowed to tryout for a female sport (softball  I believe).

My brother  who is 6'4 230lbs  just recently gave up competitive boxing. For a while there was some hope that he would turn professional  but he just couldn't seem to get over the hump. While he couldn't quite make the cut in men's heavyweight boxing  I'm sure he'd absolutely dominate women in that weight class. He joked that  if they allow this  he should become a trans woman boxer.
He would never do this and was just joking (sorry if it seems insensitive)  but I'm sure that there are some opportunists out there that would. Allowing them to do so would surely ruin women's sports.

For the record  I have no problem with a transgender man playing men's sports  just like I have no problem with a female playing men's sports (if able to compete on that level).

"CMV: The biggest mistake of environmentalists is telling people to ""save the environment"". Environmentalism is about saving ourselves.","Environmentalists (politically) made a huge miscalculation by framing their goal as humans vs. environment. As if there is a will  and a ""comfortable"" spot for the environment  and humans are disturbing it the way you might disturb your sleeping parent.

But this just isn't the reality. Environmental *change* of any kind is indisputably bad for many different species  but *the environment* is *everything*. Humans are *incapable* of destroying life on earth. We couldn't do it even if we tried with our nukes in a concerted effort... life itself is so much more monolithic than our society or species  and we don't really understand that point of view well because we don't have any predators  giving us the illusion that we *control* life.

But  back to the main point I'm making: this misunderstanding/paradigm that environmentalists subscribed to and pushed has framed environmentalism as altruism. For some people this attracts them to it  and makes them feel good about doing things like recycling. For other though it gives them the impression  because of the framing  that environmentalism is about doing things which are painful/expensive/difficult because they are ""right"".

That's a load of shit.

Environmentalism has exactly one goal: to prevent global changes to the Earth's environment that would destabilize our ability to run a functioning society. That's it.

The reason we worry about species going extinct is because 1) we don't understand much about how the species interacts with the systems we depend on and 2) some species we have direct use for. Really #1 is just ""this species *might* be part of #2"". Look at mosquitos. We have no use for them  and though it might be less than ideal from their perspective  the species that depend on mosquitos it would seem can find alternate sources. So we have seriously discussed *purposely* eradicating the species.

I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this  but whether it's right or wrong  it is not altruism. Environmentalism is and always has been about keeping the *entire world* in a state that we are comfortable with. To make things easy for us. Every single thing we want to do environmentally is  at its root  about reducing the pain/expense/difficulty that we cannot control.

By framing environmentalism as ""saving"" the environment  most people have the WRONG impression that we are somehow a threat to life itself  and it's through an act of altruistic restraint that we can redeem ourselves. But it's really that we are a threat to ourselves  and everything else is collateral damage.",139,3,3,5,5,"[['dillemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfuk8la0y6s)'], ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kalg3-csf4'], ['planet?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinction_event#effects_and_recovery)'], ['[this](http://www.nucleardarkness.org/include/nucleardarkness/files/global_nuclear_arsenal_in_number_2009.pdf)'], ['[here](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/05/nasas-actual-plan-to-deflect-an-approaching-asteroid/).']]",0,29,2,Yes
"I believe that if a woman lies to her sexual partner about taking birth control, the man bears no responsibility (financial or otherwise) for any child that is conceived. CMV","I am not completely sure of the relevant laws here  and of course they vary by country/state. But correct me if I'm wrong: if a woman says she's taking birth control but she isn't  and pregnancy results  the man is legally obligated to pay child support  right? If that's the case  I think that is extremely unjust to the man. It is a kind of sexual fraud/extortion. If a woman wants a baby  she can just trick a man into helping her conceive it  and then hand him the bill for the cost of raising it to age 18. The financial consequences of this for men can be extreme. And nothing is forcing the woman to have the baby. She could just get an abortion. The law favors her selfish interest in having the baby and somehow portrays the man as the selfish/unjust one instead if he doesn't want to strain his finances with child support. I think that instead  in cases like this  the government should provide 100% funding for the woman to get an abortion. And if the woman chooses to carry the baby to term instead  she is 100% financially responsible for raising it. 

EDIT: Woah  this is definitely my highest rated post by far. BTW [this was the post that inspired mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1o8tl2/i20m_got_a_former_coworker35f_pregnant_i_dont/). 

Thanks for all the comments  I see if I can respond to some. 

EDIT2: It occurred to me that my post might seem a little anti-women. Totally not my intention at all. So here's (I think) an equivalent moral scenario with the roles reversed. Suppose that a man wears a condom  but without the woman's knowledge  he pokes holes in it. Because the man is wearing a condom  the woman decides not to take birth control. Pregnancy results.

Does the man bear 100% responsibility for the cost of raising that child (or at least the cost of getting an abortion  if that's what the woman would prefer)? Suppose that the law burdened the woman with that cost  and let the man off scot-free. Would that be fair? A lot of people here are saying that in the other scenario (woman lying about birth control)  the man should have just worn a condom  otherwise he is being irresponsible because no method of birth control is 100% effective anyway. Well then  in this hole-poked condom scenario  do you think the woman is partially responsible for that pregnancy?

CMV: Transgender people are perpetuating gender norms.,"Let me preface by saying I support transgender people  and don't hold any hostility towards them. I just have trouble understanding their position and am looking for another viewpoint.
From my understanding  someone who is transgender sees how people of the opposite gender behave  act  and look  and decide that they feel they identify more with that than the gender their sex would indicate. It's from this I have my view.
If people just acted how they wanted to act  regardless of what's been traditionally a man/woman thing to do  we could avoid this whole label process.
Instead of identifying as another gender because you identify more with those gender norms  just do what makes you happy without applying labels to yourself.
Society would be a better place without things being inherently manly/womanly and people trying to change their identity to fit society are only allowing society to continue operating as it does.

CMV: Republicans claimed Obama was trying to be a dictator. Whatever led them to that belief should lead to a stronger conclusion about Trump.,"When Obama was president many Republicans accused him of trying to be a dictator.  The main justification for this was his use of executive orders.  Obama issued fewer executive orders than Bush  but then they responded that their complaint was about the disproportionate strength of the executive orders.  Now Trump has issued more and stronger executive orders than Obama did.  

But more than this  you can pick any standard of judgement you want to try to claim that Obama was trying to rule like a dictator.  Whatever standard of judgement that is  if used consistently  must imply that Trump is worse.

"CMV: ""Black"" is a perfectly fine way to define someone's race.","1. People use African American (yes I'm from the USA)  but a lot of the time that is inaccurate. I lived in a town with a significant Jamaican population. Teachers (trying to be as politically correct as possible) referred to them as African Americans. This angered my Jamaican friends (who had no issue with using the ambiguous term black) because they did not consider themselves African in the slightest.

2. ""White"" is a perfectly fine way to describe Caucasians. I have never seen a Caucasian person get triggered by being called white. Isn't that a double standard?

Edit: It seems like people keep going back to a person-to-person basis  which makes this completely subjective. I am coming from a general place

Edit 2: If you don't think anyone takes offense to this then you agree. You may disagree with me posting this on CMV  but you agree with my point.

Edit 3: I don't think ""black"" is an accurate way to characterize any individual  but on some types of documentation that type of information is asked. I don't say ""my black friend"" I say ""my friend Miles"". I am not trying to generalize a population in the slightest. That is what I think the term African American does even worse. You generalize everyone who looks somewhat African as African even if they're from the other side of the world.

I think Election Day should be a federal holiday. CMV,"The vast majority (if not all) elections are held on a Tuesday  the middle of the work week. This reduces voter turnout because the working class for the most part can't take time off of work to vote. In some cases  going to vote can take several hours (nearly all day in some districts) and some constituents simply can't take the time off to vote. One could postulate that the working class has the most important vote  new laws and regulations would possibly effect them more than anyone. 

1.) We all know many people don't actually get the day off during a Federal Holiday  but a business should be required to give employees at least 2 hours off on Election Day to vote. They could stagnate employee voting hours so the business is not impacted by the voting times for employees. 

2.) Presidential elections should be a federal holiday  while state elections should be state mandated. This would allow a chance for citizens to vote at all possible chances.

3.) A larger voter turnout would give a more accurate representation for the people. Many who vote are older  most likely the retired. This gives us a skewed view on the voting population and the social and fiscal beliefs of citizens  misrepresenting the country. 

I honestly can't think of any reason why Election Day shouldn't be a holiday. It may encourage more people to vote  which is a problem currently with such low voter turnout.

CMV: Voting for Hillary Clinton because she is a woman is as sexist as voting for a guy because he is male.,"It seems these days there is a lot of concern about sexism  some warranted and some not. With the upcoming election I hear some people say ""I am going to vote for Hillary because she is a woman."" One of my friends even said  ""I agree with Bernie Sanders more  but I am probably going to vote for Hillary because she is a woman."" Generally (not always) the people that say this are self identified feminists. While I have nothing against with people being a feminist  but I just don't get how people who (generally speaking) are interested in equality between man and woman can be so openly sexist.

CMV: The US should abandon the practice of tipping because it creates unnecessary tension by giving customers the opportunity to be jerks at the expense of the staff and not the manager/restaurant owner.,"I believe the tipping system in the US gives customers the opportunity to be stingy or to take their poor dining experience out undeservedly on the waiter. If the kitchen messes up an order or the restaurant is loud or service is slow  the waiter loses that tip- whether it's his fault or not. The restaurant owner may lose money indirectly because the customers might not return  but a bad experience will have an immediate impact on the server. 

Moreover  and I know it happens in a minority of cases  sometimes people are just cheap and don't tip well or at all no matter what the service is like. Again  it's the waiters and not the owners who are taking the burden of an unpleasant customer.

All this is a problem because  in the US  waiters often depend on their tips significantly (maybe servers at some restaurants do well enough that occasionally being shorted isn't really a problem  but what about waiters at less upscale restaurants  like diners?) I grew up in the US  but I've lived in the UK for the past few years (where tipping isn't as much of a thing) and now I don't understand why tipping as the US does is even necessary! In the UK  if you want to be cheap or a jerk  you're not going to be really hurting the waiter as much as in the US- they're already getting paid at least minimum wage  which is not the case of servers in the US. The system is preferable  because it gives customers an opportunity to be especially nice to their server without also giving them the opportunity to screw them over.

Please  CMV  why do we have this system in the States that leaves servers vulnerable to cheap or high-maintenance customers but protects managers?

CMV: True adherents of the teachings of Jesus would not vote Republican.,"Good faith caveat: I'm not American and I've never lived in the US. I grew up in a Christian household and was a Christian as a teenager. 

It seems to me that identity as a Christian plays more a role in Republican politics than in Democrat politics. 

For example: 

- Abortion rights
- Gay marriage
- War on Christmas
- 'Good God-fearing Americans'. 

I think this brand of Christian conservatism ignores what I think are the more fundamental teachings of Jesus: 

- We're all sinners and God forgives us
- Let he who is without sin  cast the first stone. 
- Feeding the poor
- Healing the sick. 
- The story of the Good Samaritan


Christian conservatism seems to be more about enforcing a moral code (ie. punishing sin)  than it is about Jesus' teachings of tolerance and helping the needy.  

Things like removing healthcare and foodstamps seem to be directly in opposition to this message. 

As such - I would suggest that  conservative Christianity is not so much based on the teachings of Jesus  as they are about enforcing a Bible based moral code.

CMV: Assisted suicide should be available for those without terminal illnesses.,"I think the right to die should be something every adult citizen of a developed country should have.

This would mean that a physically fit man or woman in their twenties would be able to seek assisted suicide if they felt for ANY reason that they no longer wanted to continue living.

The fact that this option does not exist causes those who go through with suicide to use methods that traumatise others  cause an inconvinence to society  risk failing and causing permanent damage to themseleves and die and excruciating undignified death.

I would say there'd need to be a 90 day waiting period so those who are making irrational circumstanial decisions can have time to reflect and cancel if they feel It's no longer something they want.

"CMV: If a Creator God aims to liberate ""lost"" humans, that essentially means that he created humans and deliberately ensured their attraction and desire to material goods and worldly pleasure so he could proceed to supposedly ""liberate"" them.","I am currently in my process of becoming an atheist and this is one of the questions I have as I lessen my belief in Hinduism. Hinduism being a henotheistic religion has the concept of a supreme God. If this world was essentially created by the Supreme God  he would have to purposefully create it too possess material wealth and worldly pleasure to lure humans off the path of devotion and worship. Seeing as his primary goal is said to be of one that liberates us mortals because of our deviation from a pure life  why would he create a world with temptations then? It makes it look as if he does this for his own enjoyment because he could easily destroy us mortals completely and our souls and create a new universe. So why would he spend time creating us and this world and then making it flawed to tempt us off the path of devotion to then proceed to attempt to liberate us? That doesn't make him all-powerful  that would make him seem like more of a well-intentioned mentor  and therefore defeat the possibility that he is the creator as then he would not have full control over this universe nor would he have been able to create it.

CMV:The proposed tax plan is a huge sellout to rich people at the expense of the middle class,"For context  I am a conservative who typically votes Republican.  I am also firmly middle class. 

The proposed tax plan is marketed as a huge boon for the middle class  by ""doubling the standard deduction"" and lowering tax rates.  

Not in the advertising however  is that standard exemptions would go away (worth $4 050 per person. So a family of four could no longer reduce their taxable income by more than $16 000).

They are also getting rid of other supposed ""exemptions and loopholes"".  When you eliminate itemized deductions like real estate taxes  state and local income taxes  medical expenses  and unreimbursed employee expenses  it's the MIDDLE class that gets hit the worst.  

Nearly half of all Americans don't pay any federal income tax at all so most of this won't even affect them.  Most of the people who will be included in the doubling of the standard deduction were already paying little to nothing in taxes so this won't help them.

If you weren't paying taxes before  your tax rate won't change.  If you were itemizing before  it looks like you'll be paying more taxes.

Who this plan helps is the rich.  Rich people would love a lowering of their rates from 39.6% to 35%.  That alone would save them more than any middle class American will save.  They will love a lowering in the corporate rate from 35 to 20%.  

Another interesting example for the true tax nerds is who the elimination of the estate tax would help.  For context  I am one of those family farmers who they pretend like they are helping with an estate tax repeal.  My family owns a farm and I would hope to inherit it one day.  I went to a succession seminar for farmers last year and the speaker told the room of 300 people ""The last thing you want is a repeal of the estate tax!"" 

Let me explain why:

Under the current rules for estate taxes  I wouldn't have to pay any estate tax because our farm is not worth anywhere near $11 000 000 which is the current married estate tax exemption. So unless you are a multi millionaire  you will never have to pay federal estate taxes anyway.  Furthermore  currently estates also get a step-up in basis.  Here's an example of what the step-up in basis is if this is new to you:

Your parents bought property for 100k 30 years ago; now it is worth 500k.  When they pass it on to you  your taxable basis in the property would step up to 500k  so that when you sold the house  you wouldn't have to pay capital gains tax on the house.  Without a step up in basis  you would have to pay capital gains tax on the full $400k difference.  

You can see how step up in basis helps middle class Americans.

A straight repeal of the estate tax only becomes preferable to a step up in basis if you are worth well North of $11-20 million.  So you can see how choosing a repeal of the estate tax at the expensive of a step up in basis is a direct choice to help rich people at the expense of the middle class.

But none of that is in the marketing.

Please  CMV!

EDIT:  I've read all 270 comments so far and will read any more than come in.  I'm blown away by the thoughtful and helpful replies.  Thank you for keeping it civil and respectful!  It is a testament to the quality of the CMV sub and it's users.

To summarize what I'm hearing from most of the comments  I tend to hear variations of a few main points:
1.  The majority seem to agree that the rich will make out very well under this tax plan and then there is debate over whether or not middle class will benefit or not.
2.  The main technical disagreements are who the middle class actually is  if a doubling of the standard deduction actually helps anyone if they have to give up personal exemptions  and then there is also some back and forth over the merits of various individual tax deductions like deductions for mortgage interest and student loans
3.  That I'm naive for believing that Republicans ever cared about the middle class in the first place
4.  Don't panic yet because this plan isn't very detailed at all yet and won't likely pass anyway

As far as the main points are concerned  I've had a handful of high income earners tell me how much they would save under this tax plan  and a handful of middle income people tell me that they think that they will have to pay more in taxes because they either live in a high tax state or have 1+ children and will suffer from the last exemptions.  Therefore  if anything my viewpoint has become solidified from these answers.  The part of my viewpoint that has changed has been my panic over this tax proposal.  A handful of people calmed me down a little bit and talked some sense into me so I'll hand out a delta or two based on that if that's acceptable.

EDIT #2: December 15 after the tax bill was released.

I'm not nearly as opposed to this as I was at the time I wrote this.  The doubling of the child tax credit  with $1400 of it being refundable  as well as keeping the step-up in basis  along with a pass-through deduction for small businesses makes this way more friendly to middle income people.  It's obviously still huge for wealthy people but I definitely think that they added some nice things for middle income people as well.

"CMV: Kids should not be able to, or be encouraged to ""come out"" and find their sexuality before they're sexually mature","There's been a lot of recent cases where children aged 13 and under have started coming out and embracing their sexuality. This means coming out gay  bisexual  transgender  pansexual  etc. 

However I think kids of that age are not old enough  nor mature enough  to understand what it means by coming out. I know being gay is a biological thing and not a choice  but if you're not even sexually active  how can you know your sexual preferences and your sexual orientation? 

The issue I see is that the act of ""coming out"" is a very supportive time  and as a result puts this idea into a kid that they actually are gay. I'm not saying being gay is bad or anything like that  being untruthful to your actual sexuality is; however. 

People supporting kids who say ""I like boys"" then saying ""honey you might be gay  but that's okay"" does nothing but put the idea that they're gay in their minds  rather than them naturally finding their sexuality through experience. 

I believe normalizing homosexuality and the likes is great  but the idea that kids can come out without having sexual experience  let alone hit puberty  shouldn't be encouraged or supported. It should be a natural process.

"CMV: The creation of girl-only programs to promote women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics at the K-12 level actually perpetuates gender stereotypes in these fields.","One of the most common ÒfixesÓ to decrease the gender gap in STEM (science  technology  engineering  and mathematics)-related fields is the creation of girl-only STEM camps  clubs  and classes in elementary  middle  and high schools.  Throughout my middle and high school years  I attended many such programs.  Most of them I walked away from feeling unchanged  but some of them insulted and angered me because they promoted a false view of women in STEM fields.  I believe that girl-only programs not only perpetuate the inequality prevalent in STEM fields but also scare away girls who otherwise might be interested in a STEM career.    

While these programs have the noble intention of showing girls that they too can be scientists  engineers  programmers  et cetera  it sends out the message to both boys and girls that females need extra help or motivation to pursue STEM careers.  Female-only programs also overuse societyÕs expectations of what is ÔgirlyÕ and I personally have been a part of programs that had girls design new containers for make-up (Òbecause most girls would rather design make-up than design carsÓ according to the presenter from Toyota) or CAD a jewelry holder.  This undermines the diverse interests that young girls have and can give them false perceptions of their options of STEM careers  turning many of them away from these fields.    

Such programs also introduce the idea of gender inequality to many students at an unnecessarily young age.  Kindergarten-aged girls donÕt need to be told that they should be scientists because most girls arenÕt Ð at that age it will most likely turn them off from the subject.  As the gender inequality in STEM fields has become more and more of a hot topic  the actual number of women pursuing these careers is decreasing.  To name just one example  there has been a 79% decline in the number of 1st year undergraduate women interested in a Computer Science major between 2000 and 2011. (http://www.techbridgegirls.org/index.php?id=44)  The strategy of telling girls that they should be programmers because few women are is not one that is going to convince many students.   
 
To summarize  I contend that girl-only STEM programs promote the existing inequalities and can scare girls away from STEM fields.  So I ask you  Reddit  CMV.

CMV: A two party system actually limits democracy.,"(I will be using the United States as my example  as it is where I know best)

Each party has a set philosophy that the candidate adheres to.

However  if there were no parties  then candidates with different views wouldn't be overshadowed and there would be a more even playing ground. 

The elections would focus more on the policies rather than personality and party.

 But as it stands  the two-party system limits change and hurts the candidates that try to bring about it.

It limits voter's ability to find a candidate they agree with.

I don't hear any musical quality in the screaming vocals found in many genres of metal music. CMV,"To be precise  I'm thinking of the vocals heard in black metal  death metal and metalcore. Something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Hv0tsvpyU)  for example.

I really have tried to keep an open mind with regard to musical taste  but metal is one genre I've had the most difficulty understanding. Why exactly do people enjoy hearing screaming or growling in songs? I find it flattens out any melodic qualities and tends to make songs practically indistinguishable from each other.


I could add that it's fairly close to hard rock  a genre I enjoy  so this isn't a distaste for heavy/loud/agressive music in general. 

**Edit**: *Thank you everyone for the brilliant response  I can say that you've certainly changed my view. Texture  atmosphere and emotion conveyed through the vocals are elements of musical quality that I was ignoring in favour of the more obvious rhythm and melody.

CMV:Transgender people have a mental illness (body dysmorphia),"I know this is a very controversial topic and I want to start off by saying I bear no ill will for anyone I am honestly here seeking the other side to the issue.  I don't understand how transgender people are not suffering from a version of body dysmorphia.  I have seen cases of individuals where they feel like they are born in the wrong body and they feel like their body should never have had legs and experience depression and other symptoms due to the difference between their idea about their body and how it actually is.  They will even go so far as to attempt to remove their own healthy limbs.  I do not see how transgender individuals are any different from this.  It would not be appropriate to remove a person's otherwise healthy legs why is it ok to do so to a person's genitals?

CMV: Anyone who is sentenced to life in prison without parole should have the option to be executed.,"  If someone receives a life sentence  they should be able to choose execution.  If they chose this option  we would not have to put them on death row or deal with appeals since it was their choice.  If they chose execution  we could do it that week.  

  This would be (1) humane to criminals and (2) beneficial to the country as a whole.

(1)  Prison is not a nice place.  A 25-year-old who is sentenced to life faces an unfathomably difficult 50 years ahead of him.  It would be humane to give him the option to end his life before all of that.  I do not think that this will in any way reduce the deterrence of crime.

(2)  Keeping a prisoner locked up is expensive  especially decade after decade.  These expense are being paid by you and me through taxes.  The people who would opt-in to execution would not cost society in this way.  They would not need a lengthy stay on death row either.  The execution itself costs nothing compared to the costs involved with keeping a prisoner alive.

"CMV: Reddit will go in exactly the same direction under Steve Huffman and no one will care, Ellen Pao was a martyr","Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of ""free speech"" in the /r/fatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman to help advance the site and create revenue. Further having money and people behind him will influence Huffman and his situation is very different from when he founded Reddit.

In regards to ""free speech"" the subreddits that make Reddit the awesome website it is are all heavily moderated. The subreddits targeted were brigading other subreddits. The administration's views on hate speech won't change  they even said in their announcement that  [""If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion  it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/)

While there will be more communication on things like the Victoria firing Reddit is still headed in exactly the same direction. **To be clear I am perfectly content with the monitization of reddit and don't see it as a big deal.** 

Ellen Pao's hatred came from her being the face of Reddit that started the changes. People latched onto her lacking resume and questionable sexual harassment lawsuit to demonize her and transform her into everything that is wrong with Reddit. She is still working at Reddit  just not as the public face of the company.

I think forcing kids to read classic novels in high school is counterproductive and turns people off reading again in the future. CMV.,"When I was a freshman in high school  one of the required reading assignments was Brave New World. As I was reading it  I didn't understand why it was so special and hated having to do worksheets and essays on it. This was pretty much the case with all other novels I read throughout high school  and it made me hate reading. Since then  I have not read a single novel for pleasure. However  now that I've gotten a little older and understand more about the world   I finally get the message Brave New World was trying to make  and now realize that the book was a masterpiece. However  since I was being forced to read books I didn't understand a few years ago  it makes me not want to actually read it again. I get that making kids read in high school is trying to open their minds to literature  but since they haven't gained the life experiences or maturity yet  it just makes reading a chore instead of something pleasurable. CMV.

EDIT: I mentioned that I had to use sparknotes to do the reading assignments. I admit that part of it was due to laziness. However if I hadn't used it  then my superficial interpretations of certain plot points would be entirely off because I hadn't picked up on the underlying themes. If I had written down my *actual* interpretations  then I would have been marked off. I don't consider using this resource as cheating. If you had a math problem that you didn't understand  and you looked on the internet for a different way of explaining it in simple English  would you consider that cheating?",326,1,2,5,7,"[['(http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/06/25/library-readers-book-type/)', '2013](http://www.pewresearch.org/2013/06/25/library-readers-book-type/),'], ['(http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_canon).'], ['criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_critics)'], ['[this](http://i.imgur.com/rcaq9hj.jpg)', '[this](http://i.imgur.com/p3zo06h.jpg)'], ['lament](http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_03_08.html)']]",0,83,0,Yes
"CMV: Gender reassignment surgery is a form of cosmetic surgery, and therefore should not be covered by health insurance.","I have a friend who is transgender. My friend (I'll call him Sam for the purposes of this post) identifies as male  despite being born with female genitalia. He lived his life like that for a long time: letting everyone know they should use male pronouns when speaking to him  wearing clothing that didn't 'accentuate' the female appearance of his body  keeping a short haircut  but otherwise going to no particular effort in order to appear especially male. I would say that for a long time  he had more of a 'gender neutral' appearance. 

Recently  Sam decided he would like to take it a step further. He began taking hormones. He's now asking friends for money to eventually help fund transition surgery  because his health insurance policy views it as a form of cosmetic surgery  and therefore does not cover it. He is also trying to petition the insurance company in order to get the surgery covered  not just for him  but for every transgender person who may come after him.  

Personally  I think the insurance company is not wrong. I understand that there are people who experience significant distress because they feel their breasts are too small or their nose has the wrong shape. I understand that it's possible to help some of those people using surgical techniques. I am not advocating against the right to choose to have  say  breast augmentation surgery. But I agree with most insurance policies  which deem those kinds of procedures purely cosmetic  and therefore do not cover them. I don't see why an exception should be made for gender reassignment surgery  or alternatively  why all cosmetic procedures (including gender reassignment) should be covered by insurance.  

What am I not understanding?

CMV : There should be no social or legal rule about hitting people that is applied differently between the genders,"EDIT #2: 


Great talk folks. This did not change my view  but it DID enlighten me as to why my view is comparatively rare---clearly folks think that  if you have a physical advantage over someone  you should give them leeway  and that if you have to hit them  it should be with a bias towards 'lightness.


I don't agree with either of those  but I do believe a rational person could hold those opinions. 


Thanks  this was easily the biggest thread I've ever started on here. Some bright folks that I respect  in a sub that has a phenomenal culture  but I retire. 


Agree to disagree



EDIT:

This has been fascinating. I think this sub is full of very reasonable ppl. So far  I no one has moved me  and it may not occur  but I admire the reasoned debate.


Most responses have hinged on ""proportionate response""---the idea that maybe he should have hit her softer. I've said it numerous times in here  but I think that is an unreasonable standard based on gendered rules and hindsight---he should have hit her hard enough to stop her but not hard enough to hurt her(?)  or maybe just restrained her because he's so strong. Keep in mind---The only way we now know that she is no match for him is because he knocked her out. That could not have been known beforehand to a level that lets us know that he should've hit her 46% less hard. 


It's in the moment  she's aggressive and escalating  and he still took multiple hits before retaliating  and only hit her once.  YOU ARE NOT BEING REALISTIC IF YOU THINK HE SHOULD HAVE RESTRAINED HER LIKE A 3 YEAR OLD. She is stronger than a 3 year old  and the other bar patrons wouldn't have allowed it. He would be vulnerable. The goal of a fight is to end a fight  and the threat to yourself  not to make sure the other combatant is definitely not hurt. 


An easy to test your argument for this sort of unrealistic gender accommodation and bias: Replace the lady with Michael Cera. 


Should Mixon restrain Michael Cera  who grabs his neck and hits his face?


Should Mixon tap Michael Cera and hope he is chastened and willingly retreats?


Michael Cera would not be being treated like a victim here because he's an adult  and would've been the aggressor  even though he's likely closer in strength to this lady than he is to a D1 running back. 


From now on  I will be responding to gendered arguments with Michael Cera substitutions  to save time. 

---ÑÑ


This is prompted by a recent video released that shows college running back Joe Mixon in a confrontation with a woman. 


The video shows them standing  then the woman pushes Mixon with both hands  then he ""pump fakes"" at her (presumably a threat)  then she grabs him by the throat and hits him in the face  then he strikes her head and she is knocked out of frame. After that  He immediately leaves. 


He was suspended  he apologized  etc. She is suing  and is referred to as ""the victim"".


I believe he did nothing wrong. I believe he is the victim. 


This is an example of a gendered rule that I think is commonly applied in the U.S.  At least: men are expected to never hit women. I think this rule is unfair  unsafe  and unrealistic.


I don't think men should hit women  but nor should women hit men. 


I don't think there is a rule about hitting that should only go one way.  


Don't beat your wife...or husband. 


No one should be allowed to hit a woman....or man. 


And conversely


You have a right to defend yourself  no matter your gender...or the gender of your attacker. 


Mixon was punished  and some say it was not enough.


I would consider my view changed if someone could describe an instance where it's ok for a woman to hit  or not ok for a man to hit  where gender is a determining factor (where you could say ""he was wrong to hit her"" but not ""that person was wrong to hit that person""). I'm looking for a moral/philosophical pov  rather than a ""holding the door  standing when a woman leaves the table"" chivalry pov. 


Holding the door for women doesn't ruin men's careers or send them to jail  but in our society  defending yourself from physical abuse might  if you're a man and your attacker is a woman.

CMV: The transgender bathroom thing is a non-issue. People who wanted attention made it an issue.,"I don't understand why anyone cares about where transgenders go to the bathroom. 

1. Transgenders have been using bathrooms for years without incident. All of a sudden it's an issue.

2. Creeps have been dressing up like women and going into girls bathrooms for years as well. All of a sudden people care about stopping them more.

3. No one pays any attention to anyone else in the bathroom anyway. so if you shared a bathroom with a trans person  how would you even notice? 

4. I hear more about this issue from people who aren't trans than from people who are. News outlets especially.

In the outrage culture we live in nowadays  it seems people get all up in arms about stuff because they ENJOY being all up in arms about something. if it wasn't this it would be something else. 

I think transgenders should  as a courtesy  use the bathroom of the gender that they appear the most like. No one will notice and we will all realize that no one actually cares. 

Sidenote: I am totally in support of transgender people and would happily share a bathroom with anybody. thanks for everyone reminding me of the plight of the trans gendered individual though.

I think the Confederate flag is nothing but a Hillbilly Swastika. CMV.,"First off let me say I dont really have any skin in this game. None of my ancestors were combatants that I know of and no one was ever a slave
However  everytime some controversy breaks out surrounding the use of the flag all i can think is that it used to be the national symbol of a country that fought 4 bitter years of war in an attempt to hold onto the institution of slavery. I cant think of any other flag that people display so proudly that has its roots in sivh an evil origin. What am i missing?

CMV: The only wasted vote is voting for somebody you don't want to be president.,"There's been a ton of talk recently about how voting for a third party is a vote for Trump/Hillary (depending on which that person prefers). Basically since I can remember the elections have seemed stale and the candidates lazy in fulfilling promises. I believe this is because the two major parties have gotten used to always depend on a reliable voting base to get their party close to winning the election. Essentially both sides know that all they have to do is be slightly less shitty than their opponent and they will get the required number of independent voters to win. Part of the reason this idea is prevalent is that people have this mentality that you have to vote for one or the other or else the other person is going to win. Basically my CMV is that the only way to break this cycle of having shitty candidates who only use attack ads and generally are unworthy to be president is to show them that the American people are willing to vote for who they actually believe in  even if they don't have a chance to win. This is because they know for almost an absolute certainty that independent voters will vote for one of the two parties. If we start to vote for who we really believe is the best choice instead of picking the lesser of two evils then both major parties will have to work harder to get those votes back from the pool of independents. Essentially we as the electorate need to force more competition. No this may take a couple of election cycles to really make a difference but I believe this election is a crucial place to start since both candidates are almost universally hated by people on all sides of the political spectrum. It doesn't matter who it is you vote for in this case  all that matters is that you tell the parties that your vote is NOT a guaranteed blue or red. Even if one or the other is still going to win it will be worth it to force competition  and thus get better candidates from both parties in the future (or else they will decidedly lose against the party that does listen and actually nominates a good candidate).

CMV: Most of the fatshaming that physicians are said do isn't actually fatshaming - it's caring about people's heath.,"I do believe that some physicians fatshame patients. I shadowed a doctor once who didn't spend as much time with overweight or obese patients and didn't explain as much to them either. He believed that overweight / obese people were stupid bc in his mind  no one would let themselves gain so much weight unless they had no consideration for their health. He didn't think he should put as much effort helping those who wouldn't help themselves. This is definitely fatshaming.

However  what isn't fatshaming is telling people that losing weight will improve their symptoms and reduce their risk of future health problems. I've read a lot of articles saying that physicians shouldn't tell patients to lose weight because it's triggering. As a future physician  I feel like I'd be doing the wrong thing by refraining from telling my patients that losing weight would improve their health or health outcomes. I want to give them all their options for improving their health.

I understand if there was a better way I needed to phrase ""you need to lose weight."" However  it seems like most people would prefer it if I never mentioned weight at all.

I would love any and all opinions  as this will impact how I practice medicine in the future!

CMV: Children born completely disabled should be euthanized.,"Ideally I would say they should never be born  but because they ARE born  everyday  I've always thought that children born completely disabled (As in  can't move by themselves  can't feed themselves  can't go to the bathroom without diapers/catheters  can't speak  can't communicate at all etc  should be euthanized. I don't know if I'm lacking some morality that most people have  or if a lot of people actually agree with me. 

It seems as though the only reason these children are kept alive is because the parents (Usually a mother) refuses to let them go. And this is what I don't understand. They spend their entire lives caring for a completely disabled child  to what end? For the child to be passed onto the next caregiver when they die? They spend their life savings on expensive medications  therapies  etc  for a child that will never get better? If a child has cancer  I completely agree with doing everything you can to save them  because there is at least a CHANCE of recovery. But these children have no chance. They are born to be cared for  and then die. They have no life. I just don't see why people let them live. 

I guess you can say  ""You wouldn't know because you've never cared for one before."" But the truth is  I don't feel like I have to. I see videos and people in real life caring for these people  and it doesn't make sense to me. Often times they even have other normal children  and those children get a shitty upbringing because the parent is so focused on raising the disabled one. My mothers sister kept their mother alive long after she should have died  just for her to be a bed vegetable. I get that there are emotions at play with these people  but it just seems really selfish to me.

"CMV: I don't believe that there is a practical solution for non-binary trans people regarding bathroom use beyond ""use the restroom you're least likely to cause a ruckus for using.","Let me start first by saying that having witnessed the personal struggle of many of my non-binary friends I am actually very empathetic to non-binary gender dysphoric people. This isn't a ""suck it up butter cup"" post. I want there to be a do-able solution for them  but the more I think about it the more I'm stumped on how society should treat this issue. Im going to try and make this quick. Here are potential solutions and problems I see with those solutions: 

Solution: use family/gender neutral restrooms.

Problem: not always available. Can be prohibitively expensive for many businesses to implement.


Solution: make all bathrooms unisex.

Problem: *I do not like this idea at all honestly but my distrust of it is somewhat emotional so it is probably my weakest chink in my view.* As a trans woman I do not want purely gender neutral restrooms. I don't want to pee next to heterosexual men (and the more I live as a reasonably attractive girl the less comfortable I am with that idea) and I believe there is at least some advantage to segregating facilities based on perceived sex. I've spent too much time arguing that allowing trans women into women's facilities is a safety issue for trans women to abandon that belief entirely.


Solution: use the bathroom of your birth sex.

Problem: many of them dont look like their birth sex. Reference my view on safety issues for trans people.


Solution: use the bathroom you most resemble.

Problem: many of them sit pretty reasonably in the middle. A lot of enby folk aim to be ungendered  (nobody is sure what they are) or may change their presentation based on how they feel that day. I believe trans rights are in a vulnerable place right now and due to cis perceptions of trans issues I am wary of someone switching bathrooms from day to day based on how they feel. I dont think it's safe to send that sort of mixed signal right now.

So the solution I'm left with is ""use the bathroom you're least likely to get the shit beat out of you in"" and you don't have to tell me that my view is problematic because I know it. I would love to have my view changed but I dont personally see the solution.",353,2,3,22,29,"[['few](https://www.google.com/amp/www.wcnc.com/amp//news/politics/stats-show-assaults-dont-happen-in-bathrooms/126572739)'], ['transwoman.](http://www.daniellemuscato.com/)'], ['toilets](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_toilet)'], ['that](https://culturallyboundgender.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/percentages-prevalence-and-why-some-women-are-freaked-out-by-this-whole-locker-room-thing/).'], ['[this](http://g02.a.alicdn.com/kf/htb1qxktipxxxxbixfxxq6xxfxxx6/200499168/htb1qxktipxxxxbixfxxq6xxfxxx6.jpg)'], ['bathroom](http://www.out.com/news-opinion/2016/4/14/girl-kicked-out-mcdonalds-using-womens-bathroom-because-staff-thought-she-was)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['bathroom](http://www.advocate.com/business/2015/06/17/detroit-woman-kicked-out-restaurant-bathroom-looking-man-sues)', 'difficulties](http://dirtywhiteboi67.blogspot.com/2014/03/butch-bathroom-blues.html)),', '[assumed](http://masteramazon.blogspot.com/2016/11/butch-knowledgebutch-oppression-and.html)'], ['rights.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/charlotteobserver.relaymedia.com/amp/opinion/op-ed/article78706432.html)'], ['ideas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/better-design-could-solve-the-debate-about-gendered-bathrooms/2016/05/13/4b54b9ee-1853-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.1a00359c6dfc)'], ['](https://youthtranscriticalprofessionals.org)', 'now](https://4thwavenow.com)'], ['signs](http://www.clker.com/cliparts/0/3/d/2/121617903283528754wariat_toilet_signs.svg.hi.png)'], ['rape.](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-statistics-ignore-crime-in-prisons-2014-7)'], ['](http://genderfluidsupport.tumblr.com/gender/)'], ['references](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3693622/)', '1991](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2029601/)', '2014](https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/testosterone-in-healthy-men-increases-their-brains-response-to-threat)'], ['article.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=90273278)'], ['http://www.ustranssurvey.org/report/'], ['threats](http://violentreceipts.tumblr.com/)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['](http://thenewbacklash.blogspot.com/p/10-transing-kids.html?m=1)'], ['pal.](https://thepoliticsofgender.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/trans-male-violence/)', 'more.](https://allisonslaw.wordpress.com/)', 'more!](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0016885)']]",1,69,1,Yes
CMV: Anyone who supports Bernie Sanders but who will vote for Trump if Hillary wins the Democratic nomination is completely uninformed on candidate policy (or doesn't care about it) and simply wants to watch the world burn.,"Ok so ""watch the world burn"" might be a little harsh. It's probably closer to simply hating the status quo so much that eliminating it is more important than anything else.

As the candidates put out more and more details regarding their policy plans  there's no doubt Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have almost nothing in common besides their hair issues and a general support for Planned Parenthood. But on the big issues that could have serious impact on the lives of people living in the US - immigration  taxes  foreign policy  gun rights  free speech  health care  higher education  and the overall size and scope of the federal government - they are close to polar opposites. 

There's no way that a person who supports Bernie  but who will vote for Trump  is thinking *""you know I'd like to have free health care and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants  but I'll settle for continuing with the current health care system and deporting all illegals.""* But last week  The Guardian asked 700 Bernie Sanders supporters who they would vote for if Hillary wins the nomination and 500 of them said they'd seriously consider Trump while only 200 said they'd vote Hillary. (Source: http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/bernie-sanders-supporters-consider-donald-trump-no-hillary-clinton )

This makes **absolutely** no sense if you consider any of the candidates stances on virtually any issue. So I believe a large percentage of Bernie Sanders supporters don't actually support him for his policies but rather because of what he represents (or rather what he *doesn't* represent). They can't stand the status quo and want to see drastic change more than they want free college or free health care or to see a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Change my view.

"CMV: Terminally ill patients should be allowed to try non-FDA, experimental drugs if allowed by their doctor","Currently  the case in the US is that patients are approved for experimental drug use on a case-by-case basis. Patients often have to make requests multiple times before being approved  and for the few that donÕt get rejected  itÕs often too late. This is often an extremely bureaucratic process as well. 

The Right-to-try law is exactly as my CMV title says. HereÕs the wiki page for it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-try_law

Firstly  the benefit to risk ratio is too great. Lives are at stake here  there is no time to wait months for an application to process. WeÕre talking about ÔpromisingÕ drugs here  not random drugs that havenÕt been tested completely yet. I think if a drug has shown positive results even in only animal trials  terminal patients should allowed to try it anyway. A low 20% chance of recovery is better than a 0% chance of recovery. Patients wouldnÕt choose experimental drugs if there were safer  mainstream alternatives. 

One of the stronger counterarguments in my opinion is that these experimental drugs can often make things worse for the patients. Or that successful animal trials donÕt necessarily translate to successful human trials. But I think that if the patient understands and consents to the fact the side effects can be harsh and unknown then itÕs okay. Basically  desperate times call for desperate measures. 

Another issue would be the drug companies/researchers not wanting to be liable for any harm that comes to the patient. I donÕt really know much about law  but isnÕt there a way of the patient (and their family) agreeing to simply not sue them? Like through a contract or something? Correct me if IÕm wrong. 

I also think that the use of experimental drugs/treatment should be kept between the doctor and the patient for now. In an ideal world maybe there would be enough time/resources to process each patientÕs application and fully consider their case quickly enough  but I donÕt think that will happen any time soon. The best and most practical solution would be to let the patient (with the guidance/recommendation of their doctor) to make decisions concerning their own health.

CMV: Most people will be harmed by AI unless we redistribute income,"Now and in the past  the economically valuable skill most people have is good enough
strength  vision  and dexterity to purposefully move objects around in
predefined ways. Some can do basic arithmetic and follow instructions. There
are a few inventors and engineers  but these tasks are beyond the capacity of
the vast majority of the population.

With AI  the tasks that most people can do can be done more cheaply by
machines  so this will leave the bulk of the population unemployable. This is
different from previous technological improvements:

* farm automation increased
the amount of food available while decreasing the number of farm workers  but
those workers could mostly get manufacturing jobs.

* automated factories are
making most factory jobs obsolete  but those people can mostly get jobs
controlling the machines in routine ways.

**When we use AI to control the machines in routine ways  this will remove the
last economically useful skill available to the majority of the
population.** Most people are not  and cannot become  inventors or engineers.

It is not clear that being an engineer is sufficient. Some engineering tasks
can be done by AIs.

It is not sufficient to assume these low-skill people will get service
jobs. First  even service jobs can be automated away. Consider recent kiosks at
McDonalds  electric massage chairs  and possible self-driving cars delivering
pizza. Second  you can only make money from service jobs if the person you are
serving has money. Only so much money can be spent on back rubs for inventors.

The question is  what happens next? We will have a large population of people
who cannot do anything economically useful  and lots of cheap goods from all of
these machines. Will the unemployed people get the cheap goods? If there is no
redistribution of income  they would have to steal it. That won't work so well
for them if law enforcement can be automated too.

One cheap way to automate law enforcement (with regard to theft) is to put the
people who would steal things far from the things that might be stolen. This is
actually happening -- an unemployed coal miner in West Virginia will typically
find it difficult to escape their local economically depressed area to get to a
place that has more hope.

I seem to recall a basic economic theorem that voluntary exchanges between
rational actors increase total wealth when there are cheaply enforceable
property rights. This works because both sides benefit (because it was
voluntary) and third parties aren't affected (because of property rights). This
has two minor problems and one apparently insurmountable one:

* Enforcing property rights seems problematic. AI-driven corporations can hire lobbyists to redefine property rights.

* Rationality of the actors is in doubt. I live within walking distance from a liquor store that also sells cigarettes. The computer I'm using to write this also offers to sell me video games. Video games are much more compelling than they used to be. The rural US has problems with methamphetamine use. In all those cases  technology exploits bugs in the motivational systems of the people involved.

* Even if we get around those somehow  the theorem doesn't say how that wealth is going to be distributed.

There is precedent for this. Horses were once the best option for
transportation and tilling fields  and then their only worthwhile skill was automated away when
everyone got cars and farms got tractors. Now at least 90% of the horses that
were present 100 years ago died or failed to reproduce. The humans are better
off with the replacements for the horses  and perhaps society as a whole was
better off  but those horses that were around 100 years ago were not better
off. Either one has to argue it is relevant that horses aren't human  or one
has to conclude that efficiency improvements can lead to the death (or failure
to reproduce) of large chunks of the population.

There is an argument called ""[comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage)"" that says that under
certain circumstances  trade is useful even if the partners trading have
different efficiencies. The classic example has the partners being different
self-sufficient countries. If the countries are self-sufficient  we have
excluded by hypothesis the scenario I'm concerned about where people are
dependent on food  and the cost of feeding the low-skill people exceeds the
cost of having a machine do their work.

If we had a low enough population density  all those otherwise unemployable
people could return to being hunter-gatherers. But we have far too many people
for that. It would be similar to what happened to the horses 100 years ago --
some are left  but most are gone.

So what happens? So far as I can tell  either:

* There will be a huge decrease in
population  accompanied by intermittent riots that are put down by increasingly
automated police. In this case I expect me and
mine to be able to avoid the first few culls  but not all of them.

* There will be a scheme that redistributes most of the
income to people with relatively low skill. If we assume an economically efficient outcome  and we assume automated policing  this is not going to happen.

[This](https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21719761-probably-not-humans-have-lot-learn-equine-experience-will-robots) relevant Economist article doesn't turn up any other options.

Change my view that there are no other options  please.

Edit: A few people proposed that we arrange for many or all people to have part time jobs instead of a few people having full time jobs. This is another way to do income redistribution. I don't see how it's better than other schemes such as the [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income)  and I don't see a way to make it stable without large government intervention.

Edit: Some people are missing main point  so I bolded it above.

CMV: There is a non-insubstantial chance that Donald Trump is executing the greatest troll in the history of the world,"I've had this nagging feeling in the back of my head for a very long time that Donald Trump isn't actually seriously running for President  but is actually trolling the world. I don't mean ""trolling"" as it has come to be defined in mainstream discourse - i.e. saying something mean is trolling. I mean the classical sense of the word  where you say things you don't necessarily mean for the purpose of getting a particular reaction out of people  and try to push it as far as you can before they realize you are bullshitting. 

My reason for this is because he says and does the exact kind of stuff that I would say and do if I wanted to troll the US/world. Everything he says is just outrageous enough to provoke reactions  but not so outrageous as to be unbelievable. He stands by what he says just long enough for the reaction to build up  before retracting his statement or moving on to something else. 

What has really pushed me further in this direction is what happened last night at the convention. Everybody is talking about how his wife's speech plagiarized Michelle Obama. That's potential evidence by itself  but the thing fewer people are talking about is the fact that she literally Rickrolled the convention. She said  ""We're never going to give up. And most important of all  we're never going to let you down."" I mean come on.

To be fair  I do think it is more likely than not that his campaign is serious. But I think the likelihood that it's the greatest troll in the history of mankind is not insubstantial.

To change my view  I'd need to see convincing evidence of something he's said or done to indicate that his campaign is completely serious  and that such statement or action couldn't reasonably be interpreted as part of the trolling.

Alternately  my view will be changed if he wins the election  serves out his term in a serious fashion (whatever that means for him) and never admits it was all trolling.

Edit: Thanks for a very interesting discussion everybody. I'd say that my view has been changed and that  while I believe the odds he is trolling are greater than 0  they're small enough that I would call them insubstantial. I've awarded a few deltas and will try to go through and give out more where warranted later tonight.

Note: there was some grumbling about my phrasing in the thread title. I purposely chose non-insubstantial instead of substantial because I believe substantial implies a much larger likelihood than I believed when making the post.

CMV: The belief that both US parties are 'equally bad' is wrong and causes serious harm,"First  I'll explain the problem  then I'll give my evidence.

Frequently in political discussions  someone will reject a criticism of republicans by saying that democrats aren't perfect either. I agree they aren't perfect and should be criticsed but they are a much less flawed choice for government for most people than republicans and it's important to make this point. Pretending otherwise can be a lazy attempt at appearing mature by making a false equivalence between both sides or apathy that justifies not paying closer attention to politics because 'they [politicians] are all the same'. This attitude led to Trump's election because people thought both sides are the same  (i.e. using private emails was equivalent to a decades long history of derogatory treatment of women because 'they're both awful').

This equivalence is wrong for the following reasons:

Firstly  [the Republicans are far more prone to abusing political rules and ignoring norms](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/gop-decay-of-political-norms/540165/). Anyone who believes both parties should behave in an ethical way can obviously criticise both parties but republicans should be condemned in far stronger terms because of their worse actions. They've made the Senate and Supreme Court far more partisan and dysfunctional and have done so purely for their own ends.

Secondly  [Republican media is far more partisan](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/2/16588964/america-epistemic-crisis) and willing to ignore evidence. People often equate MSNBC and CNN with Fox and Breitbart. This is an enormous false equivalence as the Harvard report mentioned in the above link says:

> Prominent media on the left are well distributed across the center  center-left  and left Ó the researchers found. ÒOn the right  prominent media are highly partisan.Ó

Republicans are also more likely to be [hypocritical and inconsistent with their political views](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787fdh/after_gold_star_widow_breaks_silence_trump/dornc4n/)

Thirdly  Republicans are far more likely to help the powerful at other's expense. As their [voting record shows](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6tm9h5/cmv_over_the_next_1020_years_the_biggest_threat/dlm31u9/)  republicans are more likely to [back laws that benefit the wealthy and powerful](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7a6aw5/john_mccain_is_trying_to_wake_republicans_up_from/dp7gw7u/) and more likely to oppose laws that protect the poor and powerless. [For example](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-tragedy-of-president-trumps-tribalism/544739/)  regarding their current tax plan:

> the most comprehensive nonpartisan analysis of the GOPÕs original blueprint found that it would shower fully four-fifths of its benefits on the top 1 percent of earners by 2027.

They also spent most of the summer trying to destroy the existing health care system with little thought put in to the replacement just so that could free up money for tax cuts. Democrats however  passed the ACA to increase access to health insurance and paid a heavily political price for it.

**In summary**  both parties are flawed but acting like both are equally bad is just an excuse for ignoring politics which leaves open the possibility that incredibly incompetent  ill-informed and immoral people will take power. This is exactly what has occurred. The Republican party is far less worthy of people's trust and support and more worthy of most people's suspicion and condemnation.

(Note: I know 3 of the sources I linked to are Reddit posts but they link to real sources and I haven't seen any convincing argument against them).

"CMV: I believe it is never okay to dox anyone, not even Neo-Nazis.","I do not believe that it is okay to dox people by publishing their names  identities  addresses  places of employment against their will. The only time when this is acceptable is when that person is a fugitive and the information about them you are spreading was released by a police department; and even then  you have to be very careful to ensure that any of the details about that person only came from the polic department (no follow-up information of your own should be added; it should be tipped to the PD not blasted to the public).

Outside of when you are parroting information released by a PD  you should not spread their personally identifying information against their will. This applies to everyone no matter how much they personally agree or disagree with you. Even including Neo-Nazis  who I condemn to the bone.

There was some doxxing of the Unite the Right rally protestors and as much as I despise them  I do not believe that they should be doxxed. You've opened up the door to the counterprotestors being doxxed if you're standard is ""I disagree with them vehemently so I will dox them""; those protestors despise the antifa counterprotestros just as much as the antifa members despised the protestors. I do not believe that appearing unmasked in public is tantamount to saying ""you are free to dox me by amplifying the spotlight on me"".

This also spreads the risk for false identification like what happened to an [innocent Arkansas professor](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/16/arkansas-professor-wrongly-id-d-as-torch-bearing-protester-in-charlottesville.html). You cannot take vigilanteism into your own hands. One of this very site's darkest days was when it doxxed and falsely suspected suspects in the Boston Bombing case in 2013.

Outside of when you are parroting information already released by a law enforcement agency  it is always morally impermissible and it should be illegal to publish personally identifying information about a person against their will.

"CMV: It's not racist to demand that immigrants integrate into the dominant culture, and that is better for them if they do.","There's an old saying that goes like this. ""When in Rome  do as they do"". Now  that means you should obey/respect the customs  ideals and values that the country has. Now this sounds good right. Okay  let's say that I think immigrants should also follow this line of thinking.  

Europe is facing massive problems that stem from the fact there are people coming from the Middle East who refuse to accept Western Values. In my opinion  we should give them a choice. Accept our values  our rules and accept our laws  or leave. Muslim ghettos are breeding [terrorists. ](https://www.google.com/amp/nypost.com/2016/03/22/muslim-ghettos-in-europe-are-hotbeds-for-terror/amp/). We must use this logic to preserve Western Civilization. 

Let me explain myself better. I can do whatever I want in my own house. I can walk around naked. Leave bags of chips everywhere. Crap on the rug if I want to. But I shouldn't do it in my neighbors house. It's rude  embarrassing  disgusting and disturbing. If I don't comply to the rules they lay out  they have every right to kick me out. 

Now  is this true in a reverse  where I go to Turkey and live there? I say yes. I should respect the culture of my location. Again  there house  there rules. 

In my opinion if immigrants (especially Muslims) would integrate culturally  life would be easier for everyone. There would be fewer people on welfare  fewer terrorist attacks  more people would be alive and young Muslims might have a brighter future. But instead they refuse  creating high poverty towns that no one with the cash to leave will stay in. Children are not given the education they need.

The current system allows athletes to begin competing as female once they have achieved a certain testosterone level  but this is not fully understood  and people like Laurel Hubbard (nz weightlifter who used to compete as a man) benefit from their years of training as men.

CMV: First World Privilege is a larger problem than White Privilege,"Although White Privilege is healthily discussed across the internet  there is little to no acknowledgement of the First World Privilege that is omnipresent in discussion of international issues that involve developing countries. While both types of privilege can influence the dynamics of discourse  First World Privilege is  by definition  more devastating because the ideological evangelicalism it encourages informs bad foreign policy and a significantly larger population is disadvantaged by its existence.


The comfort of life in the First World gives many a false sense of moral and political superiority. We tend to assume that the calculus that goes into another states decision or policy should be more or less the same as our own. The problem is that every state has different sociopolitical circumsances.  In fact  many are not compatible with first world values and causes for cultural/historical reasons. Even putting aside the failed wars and coups that have been launched to propel liberal ideas to prominence in ÒoppressedÓ nation states  the criticism of governments that do not meet our standards is often misguided. Progress doesnÕt happen over night and we should not hold others to unfair ethical/regulatory standards that we have put in place after functioning in a liberal democratic manner for centuries.

Context is key. In a vacuum  to criticize an international leader like Xi  in China  for an authoritarian action such as his large scale political purge  seems great from a Western vantage point  but in practice things are a lot messier. His anti-corruption campaign is popular. It has repatriated billions in corrupt money that was leaking from the Chinese Government. It also has allowed for new policies that work to combat corrupt practices  making Xi quite popular with the Chinese people.


Those in the developed world that championed the wars in Iraq and supported the Arab Spring were similarly misguided. Although Hussein  Gaddafi  and Mubarak were all detestable for their authoritarian ways  the idea that First World intervention or support for the opposition could make the situation better was laughable at best. In each of these cases  the best of intentions from the involved First World parties left the nations of Iraq  Libya  and Egypt in worse circumstances than before.


In order to have productive conversations regarding international issues  and make better foreign policy decisions  it is imperative that we consciously check our privilege before participating. Nuance is often the diffence between a productive conversation and entrenched polaric mudslinging. By being as conscious of First World Privilege as we are of White Privilege  we can find a more nuanced basis on which to hold debates regarding international issues.

CMV: People should earn the right to have children.,"This is purely hypothetical and something IÕve been thinking about recently.  
  
My position is that people should have to prove that they are capable of raising a child before they are allowed to have one  going through the same checks as Foster Carers and Adopters have to go through.  For example  check such as  Criminal Record Checks  Mental Health checks  financial viability checks and so on.  
My hypothetical theory on how this would be achieved is via an easily reversible castration which I'm fairly sure doesn't exist  but I'm not a doctor so I don't know.  
  
My reasons for this:  
 * This would greatly decrease the number of neglected children born to parents who are abusive  incapable or uninterested in raising their child. This decrease would lift the burden on social care services and would save local councils large amounts of money.  
 * This would also reduce the number of children born into poverty.  
 * It would stop teenaged pregnancies.  
  
A good metaphor for how I see this subject is as such: ÒIf someone was unfit to drive a car  they would not be allowed to buy and drive a car  yet if they built their own car  theyÕre free to drive when and where they want. .. until the crash and a social worker has to spend months in court trying to get the car taken away for its own safety.Ó  
This doesn't mean that just the wealthy and healthy would be able to have kids  just that the people who really shouldn't have kids would be prevented.   
I know it does sound a touch like eugenics and it's not something I can see ever being in place. It's a recent idea that I'm still working over the pros and cons. Currently  I feel that the Pros far outweigh the Cons.   
The Cons that are glaringly apparent are:   
* Having Kids is a basic human right.  
* The actual possibility of such a procedure.  
  
But please  Change my view.

"CMV: Black people need to begin accepting their own responsibility for their problems; it is black criminality/culture that is causing the black community's problems, NOT white racism. [Serious]","**[This post is politically incorrect. This post may be thought of as NSFW to some. Please only give me serious responses here. Simply saying  without addressing the argument  ""You are a racist"" is not an argument. If you wish to disparage or hate me  feel free to do so; I only request you do so by citing logic that counters the arguments I make.]**

Hey all! I've been doing research into a subject that has infuriated me for over a year and a half (since Ferguson)  and as I've done more research  I've began to question what I've been thinking.

At first  I was infuriated at white racism  and thought that there was some sort of systemic racism going on here. But as I watched more alternative media sources  as I've done more research into criminality and race  as I've dug past the mainstream media's we-think-for-you narrative... I've begun to realize that I was acting immature. I was being presumptuous. I was calling for the end of ""innocent until proven guilty"". I was allowing the media to control me  and I wasn't thinking for myself.

In the interest of being succinct  I will just list the statistics I find that have made me question things  in ROUGH order of importance:

* Black people are killed by police officers disproportionately... just as they commit crimes disproportionately. Blacks have significantly higher rates of criminality (assault  theft and homicide just to name some) than white people  disproportionate to how they are outnumbered 5-to-1 by whites.
* Black fatherlessness and a broken family dynamic. Over 70% of blacks born to unwed mothers  many blacks being born into fatherlessness homes. Our culture does not seem to take seriously how growing up without a father (and on that note  child abuse) is seriously detrimental to it's community.
* How our culture of political correctness makes it impossible for anyone to have rational discussions about these points by shouting down anyone who raises questions about them as racist! That's something I've really begun to notice.
* How black people (esp. Black Lives Matter) spend far more time protesting perceived white racism than they do protesting their own internal problems (black-on-black crime  black fatherlessness  the broken culture etc.). I really wish BLM protested the aforementioned issues. That really could fix a lot.
* Black culture glorifies and glamorizes the criminal life. Rap  drug culture  etc.
* (side note): This is NOT to say that I do not believe there is any white responsibility for black actions. Eric Garner  Freddie Gray  Tamir Rice -- I do believe that all of those men  ESPECIALLY Garner  were killed unjustly. I am not saying in any way that *all* responsibility is on black  but I am saying that most of it is. Fixing the internal problems will be both a lot less difficult and a lot more repairing than trying to fix the white side.

**Conclusion**: The black community's broken state is largely due to itself. If you want change in the black community  you need to repair ti. First  get rid of this PC culture that essentially censors anyone who tries to bring up these issues. Then  the AA community can admit it has an issue (you can't fix a problem you deny). From there can we start fixing things. With cultural reformation (particularly in how we treat  raise and discipline children  and how we treat peers of ours who make irresponsible decisions to have kids prematurely)  we can make some real changes in the black community.

However  since people often refuse to discuss this issue and write me off as racist (proving my third point BTW)  I've begun to wonder if maybe my original standpoint (that *everything* is to blame on white people) is right.

So Reddit  can you change my view  or can you tell me you agree with it? I love to hear your thoughts!

**EDIT**: Was unsure I would get such an interesting conversation going (I was afraid of being dismissively and presumptuously called a racist!)  but I'm happy to see so much information here. Thank you very much Reddit  you have helped inform me. Information I was previously unaware of greatly has helped me. In particular I want to thank u/wiibiiz; his comment was so informative and informed me of the true deetails of an atrocious plight which I were previously wholly oblivious to. Thanks to you all!

I am now on both sides of the aisle. I do still stand in my belief that the black community needs a reexamination and cultural adjustment  but now I also believe (even stronger than before) that the systemic racism and war on drugs (prison-industrial complex) needs to be reformed as well.",478,6,19,66,166,"[['times](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/10/charles-barkley-russell-wilson-seattle-seahawks)'],

CMV: Giving other cultures sh*t about eating dog meat is hypocritical,"Hi all 

So someone just posted a video on my FB feed about [the Yulin dog meat festival](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yulin+dog+meat+festival). It is horrifying...

For the purpose of this CMV  let's forget about how it's done (the way they get the dogs  they treat them... etc.) and concentrate **only** on the dog meat eating part.

I love dogs  and yes  I find it horrifying that other cultures eat them. However  I also understand that for other cultures  it is horrifying to see us eat beef or pork.

In my opinion  the only situation where you are allowed to complain is if you are talking about eating animal meat in general. But if you enjoy eating a good steak  then it is hypocritical to criticize others for eating what they consider is ""just meat"".

Again  I am stressing the fact that this is not about the *animal cruelty* part. It's just about the meat eating. For the sake of this CMV  let's suppose that the animals are bred and slaughtered in the most humane possible way.

So... CMV

CMV: Women who fear random men are being sexist and propagating illogical fear,"I didn't know exactly how to phrase it  but I believe the way I did in the title sums up what my view is.

There is a lot of fears going on nowadays  and a very common one is when women say that when walking alone or when doing their everyday shores alone they fear when a strange man is walking behind them or when a group of men is just sitting at a bench or whatever. The problem is that this fear is supported and given validity and if you would say the same thing  but switch men with some ethnic group you would be considered a racist.

Imagine the following scenario  if I am at a bank checking my account and three black men walk inside (presumably to do the same that I am doing) if I start telling my friends that I was afraid of the three black guys I would be labled a racist  and with reason. There is nothing that can be associated with those men and being bank robbers  however because of the color of their skin  I am afraid of them. I am judging them  negatively  by a physical attribute. I think everyone can agree that this is a very damaging behavior for our society. It just creates more exclusion rather than being more open towards other people.

However now switch the roles  and women are given a free card to be afraid of someone else just because they are men.

Now the main argument here is that a man can overpower a women very easily. Well although this is true  its also true for another man. I may be a man but if I am sucker punched I will fall flat on the ground  and probably the vast majority of men. This is not like the movies where two guys exchange blows at each other. I've been sucker punched and its lights out instantly  you don't even see it comming (And yes I've seen my fair share of people getting sucker punched  and the end result is always the same  the guy falls over and the other guy just keeps bashing him until he gets tired  or someone stops the ""fight""  there is no chance what so ever.)

I think encouraging this behavior and accepting as an ok attitude to have  just creates more fear and more separation between men and women  when we should be fighting for more equality and tolerance. Since most women will share their ""scary encounters"" with other women  it will just create this non stop cicle of paranoia.

With this I am not saying that there aren't crazy people out there  but those are crazy people  and crazy people be crazy. Fearing a random men is just sexist because there is nothing that can be associated with being a crazy murderer and being a men.

Why I want my view change? Because the few times I was debating this with my female friends its normally replied with just ""You don't get it because you are not a woman"" and it scalates beyond the point where both parts just start insulting and I honestly don't like that I have a view that offends people so badly.

EIDT: For every people arguing one way you have exactly another one arguing the opposite. One say that they are not fearing men but the situation at hand  others are claiming that its a logical fear to fear men because statistically we are more dangerous  so I guess you guys can continue to argue with each other since there is no concensus between this topic. 

I still think its a sexist thing however I will give creddit to u/bawiddah with his response (https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/65x4gx/cmv_women_who_fear_random_men_are_being_sexist/dgdzwdy/)

There were others similar and also helpful but now I can see the point of view and I will at least stop being vocal about this issue. 

Also thanks for the personal attacks on myself it really chnage my view...

"CMV: Pro-choice and pro-life stances are BOTH morally defensible positions, and neither is provably superior given difficulties in the epistemology of personhood.","This is not a legal nor a practical argument  but a moral one. I have recently come to the conclusion that both pro-life and pro-choice stances are morally defensible. Many people tell me one or the other is to some extent an 'evil' position; if you can show this to be the case  I will change my view. 

I will provide limited definitions of terms in order to focus the discussion.


* **Pro-choice**: abortion should be allowed at least under typical circumstances (no claims about exceptional cases such as late term elective abortion) 

* **Pro-life**: abortion should not be allowed at least under typical circumstances (no claims about exceptional cases such as rape  or health concerns of the mother)
3. **Typical circumstances**: [first trimester  non-health or rape related abortion](http://abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics)
4. **Morally defensible**: outside the realm of condemned moral action according to basic established/accepted moral values upon which there is a wide consensus (such as ""slavery for no reason is wrong""  ""murder for no reason is wrong""). An example of a morally indefensible act would be murdering someone for no reason. Perhaps more accurately worded as ""morally defensible according to generally accepted moral precepts.""
6. **Personhood**: a term ascribed to *at least* typical adult humans that bestows a set of moral and legal rights including rights to life  choice  freedom  etc.

MY POSITION (I am interested in arguing the following  not the above definitions)

1. I argue that the following are **established/accepted basic moral claims** upon which there is a wide consensus:
 
 **a.** It is wrong to force pregnancy and labor upon a person for no reason.
 
  **b.** It is wrong to kill a person for no reason.

 **c.** Given a typical adult human  it is morally worse to kill that person (b.) than it is to force pregnancy and labor upon that same person (c.)  though both are bad. (N.B. most pro-choicers will argue that this dichotomy is not similar to the abortion decision  but that argument refers to (3a.))

2. I argue that following moral claims are **NOT sufficiently established/accepted** and therefore CANNOT be used in the adjudication of what is/is not morally defensible (typical objections in parentheses)

 **a.** A mother has a special duty to protect her unborn fetus (if fetus is not a person  many would deny this duty).

 **b.** The interior of a mother's body is a special domain in which she has absolute moral jurisdiction (many think this consideration to be overruled by a person's right to life  esp. if said person is brought into existence as a predictable side-effect of the woman's choice (c.) i.e. the person was 'put in this dangerous position' by the mother).

 **c.** By choosing to have sex a person forfeits the moral right to an abortion  because they have chosen an activity which directly results in pregnancy as birth control is never 100% effective (the typical aborting mother cannot be said to have 'chosen to get pregnant'; it was an unintended side effect [a smoker does not choose to get lung cancer]. Even if they did choose to get pregnant  that should not rule out healthcare if that healthcare does not harm anyone else (3a.) ). 

 **d.** Abortion is not killing  it is simply leaving the fetus to its own devices  i.e. 'letting die'  which avoids (1b.) (a more intuitive interpretation of leaving the fetus alone is 'letting live' [abortion requires action]  and it is not acceptable to 'let a newborn die' by removing its support  which brings us back to (3a.). 

 **e.** Abortion is immoral because it risks killing a person (the inverse could also be argued  [stopping abortion is wrong because it risks forcing pregnancy and labor for nothing]  some argue that there is little to no chance that the fetus is a person (3a.) ).

 **f.** Miscarriage is not treated as a tragedy  therefore fetus death is no big deal and abortion isn't wrong ([miscarriage is a tragedy for many](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/)  and death by 'natural causes' may be moral while death by intentional action is not [see objections to (d.) ]).


 **g.** The [Thalidomide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide) argument: we consider it wrong to knowingly mutilate your fetus  and killing is worse than mutilation  therefore abortion is wrong (Thalidomide ends up hurting a definite person [the born baby]  whereas the abortion only hurts the fetus  as the baby never comes to be). 

3. I argue that the following are convincing epistemological claims: 

  **a.** We do not know to an adequate degree if the typical (see above) abortion fetus is a person in a morally similar sense to the typical adult human. The heated debate and seeming lack of knock-down arguments on this issue leads me to think that we simply do not know at this point.

  **b.** We do not know to an adequate degree whether there is more or less than a 50% likelihood that a typical abortion fetus is a person in a similar sense to the typical adult human.

4. Given (3a.)  we do not know if (1c.) translates to the fetus or not.
5. Outside of the above-mentioned claims  there are no further accepted/established moral claims supported by a consensus or a relatively irrefutable argument that show pro-life/pro-choice positions to be morally wrong. Any relevant moral claims would fall under (2.) as being not sufficiently established/accepted.

6. Given (2.)  (4.)  and (5.)  there is no commonly established moral ground that definitively inculpates either stance.

7. Given (3b) and the debatable weightings appropriate to controversial moral claims  we cannot prove either stance to be superior.

:. Both pro-life and pro-choice stances are morally defensible positions  and neither is provably superior given difficulties in the epistemology of personhood.


P.S. As this is a longer argument  please reference which part you are challenging (or if you are challenging the argument's form)  so further discussion may be focused. 

P.P.S. Please note that arguments falling under (2.) must only be shown to be controversial/debatable for my argument to stand.

EDIT: Thank you for some excellent pro-choice considerations  especially from /u/divinesleeper and /u/nomnommish which I highly recommend reading. I've definitely had to flesh out areas of this argument  though I can't say my view has yet changed  possibly due to the fairly weak (modest) claims of the original post.

CMV: Bottled water should be more heavily taxed to sponsor water conservation/tap usage,"From the systematic removal of water from drought effected regions to the climbing numbers of non-degradable plastic waste  bottled water has presented a number of complicated issues for both consumers and the environment impacted by it's effects. I believe that bottled water should possess a tax intended to impede or prevent widespread sales. 

These taxes would perform no differently then tobacco or alcohol taxes  with the primary goal of funding less expensive water conservation efforts and to help focus the public on using public tap water available for fractions of the cost of bottled water sources. These taxes should also be used to improve water conditions for all citizens and expanding tab sources for regions where tap water is not available or unsafe. 

In the event of national emergencies this tax would be reimbursed or temporarily removed to accommodate the areas needing an external source of water. 

A measure like this would provide increased funds to make tab and public water sources more efficient  even less expensive  and more widespread.

"CMV: Modern Christian Evangelical beliefs are a charade that gives people a reason to be selfish, judgmental and almost completely un-Christ like.","Evangelicals typically believe in a Ôprosperity principleÕ  if you are a ÔgoodÕ person  good things will happen to you and you deserve those good things.


Christ believed that everyone is good  that the most horrible acts can be forgiven  and that people should take care of each other.


(I realize the above sentences are huge-oversimplifications)


IsnÕt modern evangelical belief just a way to justify being selfish  only looking out for yourself  and feeling justified in denigrating others as not worthy of support  rights  equality and so on?



Response:
Wow  CMV is an AMAZING corner of the internet.  Thank you to all.  What a great collection of thoughtful and thorough responses.

I'd like to apologize for my poor choice of words and overly simplistic description of a very complex and nuanced topic.

Despite my poor setup  I think the majority of the discussion hit close to the core of the topic.

I'm afraid that at its core  my view has not changed.  What HAS changed is my generalizations about what an evangelical is and what ""they"" believe.

As with anything that touches religion  opinions are diverse  complex and deeply personal.  To make blanket statements is disrespectful and likely incorrect.

While my general view has not changed  I now see more clearly the distinction between an evangelical Christian and evangelical politics.  Also  I suspect there is a distinct difference between evangelical Christians and the so called mega churches that are led by 'charismatics' who often wade in to politics.

I suspect that if I were an evangelical Christian (I am not)  I would seek a different label to distance myself from the evangelical label that is often thrown around in the media.

Thanks again  what an amazing sub...

"CMV: There was nothing special about 2016, bad events happen and people die every year. The internet just exaggerates everything.","I was watching a Jon Oliver show and there was one segment where he describes all the bad and unusual things that happened in 2016 ( celebrity deaths  Trump being elected  Cubs winning  ect.) and he ended his show with ""fuck you 2016!""  acting like 2016 is somehow a year that stands out from the rest (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9t2H1fC2hY).

This morning I read an AskReddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5f5gk1/with_2016_ending_soon_what_event_would_perfectly/) with people exaggerating how 2016 was ""so bad"" and it was such a different year than the rest  well it was not.

Celebrity deaths  unlikable presidential candidates being elected  and unlikely sport teams winning the championship happen every year. Let me ask you  did you all say ""omg! The Boston Red Sox won the World Series (2004)  what a crazy year!"" or ""Fuck you 2014  Robin Williams died  what a crazy year!"" No you did not  most of you think that 2016 is somehow different because social media and the internet over all focuses on things like celebrity deaths  gorillas getting shot  and other occurrences that the internet loves. I am sure most of you had never thought about Prince or David Bowie (or even heard their music) before until they died  now you all are mourning over their loss and hate 2016 because of it? Please  it seems like a lot of you just follow the trend.

For those that say ""fuck you 2016!""   you are just following a trend on the internet. Bad shit happens ever year. People in 1939 would be laughing at those who say ""fuck you 2016"" when countries are being invaded by the Nazis and now the world is at war. Celebrities dying is such a minuscule event and it is not enough a reason for a year to be bad  get over yourselves.

Yes  I do understand that people have a right to not like a year when personal things happen in their lives (death of a family member  job loss  bankrupcy  ect.)  but going ""Fuck you 2016!"" is offensive because most of the people saying this are from first world countries that have an internet connection and are really not having a bad year. The reason why I am so offended by this because it is such a first world problem and the world use to be in such turmoil in the past. It is offensive for those humans who lived through some atrocious events. Get over yourselves  there is nothing different about this year.

CMV: Nearly all articles about Trump's slipping approval ratings are pointless and misleading exercises in affirmation,"I have seen an intermittent  but steady stream of [Reddit] links to articles about Trump's slipping approval ratings. Many of the comments in the [Reddit] threads to these [Reddit] links are to the effect of ""told you so!"" and holding out hope that waves of former Trump voters are going to vote against him and his party in upcoming elections. Based on this stream of headlines  you'd be forgiven for thinking that Trump's approval must be in single digits by now. 

But it's not. When you account for noise  [his approval ratings have held fairly steady](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/voters/)  becauseÉ

Tribal politics is the new normal. There were plenty of people who didn't have a rosy opinion of Trump during the election but voted for him anyways because *those libtards are tryin' to take muh freedom!* 

Individual polls mean fuck-all. Of all the polling that is done  FiveThirtyEight (see link above) does the most work into evaluating and averaging polls and puts them into context. And they are the first to remind readers that polling has to be read with a huge grain of salt.

By promoting these stupid Trump approval slipping stories [on Reddit]  opponents of Trump are returning to their bubble  telling themselves a comforting fairytale and are blinding themselves to the political reality.

CMV: The troops get way too much respect in America.,"I intentionally didn't post this yesterday out of respect  I'm not a total sub-human.

People complain about a lack of bipartisanship in politics  but nothing has more bipartisan agreement than supporting the troops.

I understand any war where there was a draft.  And even then  I'm using 'support' in the sense that I feel sorry that the government forced these people to risk their lives.  I have respect for anyone that fought in World War 1 or 2  they fought for something important.  

But the days of drafts are long behind us  anyone currently in the military signed up on their own volition  they knew all the perils that lay ahead and they went forth anyhow.  Now you might say that is the point  they knowingly risked their lives for this country and deserve our respect  while we lay on the couch eating cheetos and watching sports bloopers  they are risking their lives to preserve freedom.   

Except not  not only is the risk of dying in war gone down tremendously  most people in this country aren't fond of these wars to begin with.  If you aren't for the war  how can you support the troops?  People have a problem with Wall Street and don't forgive the brave bankers who tirelessly work 15 hour days.  We have a problem with big energy and we donÕt forgive individual polluters.  Troops are the only people that get a pass for something like this.

IÕm not saying we should defund the VA  troops do not make a lot of money and the VA is a method of deferred payment and a little insurance against anything bad happening overseas.

IÕm more against how everyone on both sides of the isle pretend that these troops are these magnificent people and if you donÕt support them youÕre evil.  It just sounds like basic manipulation  Ôyou are doing something dumb so I can advance my political agenda so IÕm going to kiss your ass and call you brave so you keep on doing it.Õ

Maybe IÕm missing something fundamental here  and as always  CMV!

CMV: Felons should be allowed to vote,"Felons should be able given the chance to vote after completing their sentences because theyÕve served their time and paid back their debt to society. Everyone deserves a second chance. Of course I understand that we canÕt have pedophiles  violent murders.. etc people voting for the general population but we canÕt exclude them the other ex-felons either. WhatÕs the point of being a democratic society if our votes donÕt show the general consensus of our people but only a a select percentage. Another reason is that  not being able to vote has been shown to increase recidivism rates. Maine and Vermont are the only states that don't have exclusions for felons. I'm not saying we should follow their model but we should give felons more room to be able to reintegrate back into society. Giving them their voting rights back are on of the first steps. The more we exclude a felon the higher chance they have that they will return to a life of crime. Change my view and tell me why felons shouldnÕt be allowed to vote after serving their sentence + probation/parole.

CMV: Logic and Philosophy should be taught at a younger age to better education and prepare our youth for more complex jobs and an overall more educated culture.,I believe that Logic and Philosophy should be taught at a much younger age to improve critical thinking  arguments  and to open the door to different career choices such as programming and mathematics. A more educated populus is also good because people become more open minded and open to differing viewpoints. America seems to be lacking in these areas as shown by our world ranking for education and loss of more advanced jobs such as programmers and doctors. Our current polarization when it comes to social issues is a problem in it's own right. Logic and Philosophy are both important for opening your mind to be ideas and can both help with other areas of learning. Critical thinking is an extremely important skill in today's career fields. It allows an individual to be innovative  a better problem solver   and more open minded to any new idea they may run across.  Not only is it an important skill for jobs but it also pushes individuals to look their own perceptions  biases  and world view  which is good for any culture.,164,0,0,6,30,"[['[alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-jacques_rousseau#education_and_child_rearing).'], ['chmess](https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/chmess.pdf).'], ['[banking](http://www.learnnc.org/reference/banking+model+of+education)'], ['outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydlptaki3o8)'], ['http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/'], ['schools](http://www.abacus-es.com/journal/education-theory/advantages-of-the-one-room-schoolhouse-approach-to-teaching/)', 'school](http://www.countryschoolassociation.org/the%20cosmopolitan%20one%20room%20school.pdf)', 'schools](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lessons-to-be-learned-from-a-one-room-schoolhouse/)', 'kids](http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/)', 'students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_school-to-prison_link)', 'education](http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa662.pdf)', 'education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkbdsekbn-i)', 'education](https://egwestcentre.com/2008/12/24/crowding-out-in-education/)', 'valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx78ikhinsc)', 'etc.](http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2012/01/20/physically-active-children-perform-better-academically.aspx)', 'academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)', 'books](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=2245146011)', 'scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)', 'ware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)', 'courses](http://oyc.yale.edu/)', 'book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/how_to_read_a_book)', 'list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/how_to_read_a_book#reading_list_.281972_edition.29)', ':)](http://nautil.us/issue/17/big-bangs/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math)', 'really.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201002/children-teach-themselves-read)', 'anything](http://www.ratedcolleges.com/blog/2009/100-amazing-how-to-sites-to-teach-yourself-anything/)', 'employable](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/11/hipsters_on_food_stamps.html)', 'classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harvard_classics)', 'world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_books_of_the_western_world)', 'century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_books_of_the_20th_century)', '[coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)']]",0,45,0,Yes

CMV:Having a disadvantaged upbringing in terms of abuse or just poverty leads to a severe disadvantage at near all later parts of life.,"I believe this for two main reasons and would be very happy if anyone would be able to change my view on either of them.

1- The less obvious one: (based on mentions of studies from podcasts etc that I have not been able to find myself). Going through hardship since an early stage causes overdevelopment of the wrong parts of the brain. Instead of building social skills and other important areas of life I believe that victims of child abuse spend too much time in distressed states and that impoverished children spend too much time worried about their families financial well-being. This changes the cognitive development priority order slightly as the brain is influenced by the greatly increased exposure to 'negative' mental states and the chemicals that accompany them.

I know there are many examples of people that have disadvantaged backgrounds and still achieve success but I also believe this is a result of survivorship bias. By and large I believe the effect of early disadvantages is a large negative influence.

**tl dr:**abuse  neglect or poverty lead to increased exposure to negative mental states which hampers development.


2- The more obvious one: Children whose parents do not/can not support them naturally have less opportunities to develop and demonstrate skills. E.g. Private tuition and extra curricular development.

My overarching fear is that science supports this notion but I hope that is either incorrect or only a highly small effect that can be overcome by the personal decisions of the child. Thanks for any answers.



 
EDIT: Thanks for all the conversation. I dont have my glasses with me so will return tomorrow and hopefully be able to give out a delta.

"In my mind, President Obama is a liar and has lost total credibility due to the NSA scandal and his subsequent pursuit of Snowden. PLEASE CMV","I am by no means an expert on this topic  but from what I have gleaned it seems as though the NSA wiretapping/spying is grossly unconstitutional. But more than that  it is the type of governmental behavior that Obama promised he would put a stop to when he took office. He also promised he would protect whistleblowers  but instead of giving Snowden the protection and respect he deserved for revealing a clearly illegal government program  Obama pursued him relentlessly.
  
On a recent Jay Leno appearance  it seemed as if President Obama (at worst) directly lied about many different aspects of the NSA's domestic spying  or (at best) was completely oblivious to the realities of the program. He stated that there is federal court oversight. While that may be *technically* true  from what I've heard the overseeing court has never once said no to a single NSA request  and has essentially given the NSA carte blanche. Furthermore  Obama said there was no spying on Americans. That is just simply untrue  as multiple sources have confirmed.
  
**Please understand:**  Though the constitutionality of the NSA domestic surveillance and the pursuit of Snowden are indirectly related to my CMV  the crux of my post is that Obama has both lied and failed to make good on his campaign promises in a huge way  and has therefore lost *credibility*.
  
I don't enjoy having no respect for my president  and I actually was a tentative Obama supporter before this. Please CMV.

Edit: I apologize for the delay in responding  I was away from my computer.

CMV: Guns are a real danger to people and countries without them just fare better.,"I'm from the UK. I've heard many of the arguments on both sides  but to me nothing is more convincing than the statistics (example: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34996604). I'm also a libertarian  I fully understand that if anything a right to bear arms is needed because any other way is a breach of personal liberty. However  I can't help but see that as a negative side effect of full liberty  because inevitably it just leads to more people getting hurt. That's the numbers talking.

Yes  cars also kill people  but I don't need a gun to get to work. The benefits of having cars in society vastly outweight the drawbacks. With guns  the only benefits arise when a really tough intruder is in my house or when the government is trying to oppress me. In the UK we still manage to survive a break in without shooting everything in sight  and if the government came after us  they'd likely win even if we had a gun.

CMV: Boys and Girls below the age of 18 are not mature or developed enough to determine their gender is not the one with which they were born.,"I am starting to notice that there are transgendered children as young as 12 years old (from what I've seen).  Gavin Grimm  for example  is a transgendered boy (ftm) who is trying to sue to allow transgenders to use the bathrooms in schools that fit their identified gender.  He is only 15 years old. 

However  I don't believe any child under 18 has enough of a grasp of sexuality to truly understand it  and assigning labels at such a young age may force their brains to develop with that typecast as opposed to outgrowing a potential phase.

This is problematic because the transgender community faces discrimination  mental health issues (depression  [suicide](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/08/16/transgender-individuals-face-high-rates--suicide-attempts/31626633/)  etc)  and generally more problems than someone who isn't transgender.  I don't think it's healthy to reinforce a position that may cause them problems in the future until their brains are more fully developed. 

I'm not transphobic by any means  but if you aren't mature enough to consent to sex  buy cigarettes  get a tattoo  vote for a politician  or even look at pornography  I don't believe you're mature enough to make a (potentially) permanent decision regarding your sexual identity.

Change my view.

Edit:  To clarify... I'd want that decision to come solely from an internal feeling  as opposed to potential outside influences that he/she may feel inclined to abide by as his/her brain develops. 

Edit 2:  People are *really* fixated on the arbitrary age of 18.  I have to choose a random age to make the point that they need to be *emotionally mature* enough to understand the consequences of their decisions.  Since it's widely accepted that the brain significantly slows development at or around the age of 18  it's the age I chose. Some people are more mature at 16 than others at 20  but if there is going to be a guideline that protects children  I think 18 is a proper age.   My main point is that children who are far younger than that (as young as 10 years old) are being treated for gender dysphoria.  Please focus on that  and not on the fact that nobody magically changes when they turn 18.

"CMV: Forcing prisoners to purchase basic toiletries, food and hygiene items is cruel and unusual punishment, especially when they make pennies per hour working, often for companies that profit from their labor.","Prisons and jails in the United States often do not provide basic necessary items  such as toilet paper  soap  toothpaste  or floss to prisoners  forcing them to purchase these items at commissary (a store for prisoners).

These items should be provided free of cost to all prisoners  as they are essential to health.

Further  often prisoners must work to purchase these items  but are paid a most unfair wage. Payscale for federal prisoners is between $0.10 and $0.40 per hour.
source: http://www.prisonpolicy.org/prisonindex/prisonlabor.html

Despite these slavery-level wages  prisoners are overcharged for basic items. While ordinary citizens have the opportunity to purchase value packs of basic toiletries  prisoners must purchase them piecemeal  one at a time. For instance  a bar of Dove soap costs a Federal Prisoner $1.65 to purchase from commissary. At a grocery store  it is not uncommon to find an 8-pack of dove soap for around $8.99  a significant savings. Prisons purchase in bulk and profit by selling individually packaged items to prisoners. 

List of Commissary Items (PDF): http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/eng/ENG_CommList.pdf

Worse still  families of prisoners wishing to provide basic items for their loved ones must frequently submit their financial gifts through JPay  a prison payments processor. JPay can take as much as 40% of the funds transferred as fees  effectively doubling the cost of the necessary items. 

Prisons and jails and private contractors are forcing the financial burdens of bad policies onto families and prisoners who have no recourse  enabling ever greater budgets and profits for these entities. 

This situation is nothing short of cruel and unusual punishment  and should be banished in accordance with the 8th amendment. Prisoners should be paid minimum wage for their labor  and should not be forced to purchase basic items that are required for health. Money deposited to commissary accounts should be free of fees and charges. 

Correcting this would allow prisoners to save money  pay their fines and legal fees and be more prepared to enter the real world upon release  reducing recidivism overall.

CMV: I don't believe it's any more racist for me to imitate an Indian accent than it is for me to imitate a British accent.,"I recently made a joke among some friends wherein I imitated an Indian accent. One of my friends pointed out that that was slightly racist. I don't see how it possibly could be. First  the joke was not the accent itself or the culture of the person in question  the joke was on something the person  who happened to be Indian did. If they had been British it would've been a British accent. Second  why would this be racist? What does an accent have to do with race? Aren't accents attributed to culture?

CMV: One of the Presidential Debates should be a quiz bowl style event rather than a head to head debate.,"To start: I believe that it's important for a Presidential candidate to have broad knowledge of issues that might be relevant. I don't think that knowledge needs to be particularly deep  but I think that it is important that a candidate is knowledgeable enough to ask good questions of their more specialized advisors.

With that said  the people deserve to know how much the candidates know about the world and how it works. Questions might range from geography (""name the Nordic Countries"") to basic legal stuff (""*DC v Heller* is a case relating to which amendment"")  to international relations and global issues (""what is a difference between shi'a and sunni islam"").

This kind of event should be done one on one with a moderator and the candidate  no audience  no other candidates. The candidate would not be told whether they were correct  partially correct  or incorrect  but the audience would know via an overlay.

I think this would lead to a better class of candidate.

Edits for clarity (a delta was awarded for convincing me that my original post was too vague):

1) I do *not* think this should be a glitzy affair. No scoreboard. No loud buzzers. The tone should be more C-SPAN than *Wheel of Fortune*

2) To choose questions  something that has come up a lot: First  solicit questions from a broad range of interested people and groups. Then sort out any duplicates. Then remove any questions that have any possibility of grey areas in terms of a correct or incorrect answer. This leaves  ideally  a pool of dozens to hundreds of possible questions on a wide variety of topics that can then be chosen at random.

CMV: I think being proud of your race is ridiculous.,"Disclaimer: i'm an American middle class white girl  so no one cares what i have to say about race.

Now that that's been said  i just think the concept of being proud of your race doesn't make any sense. You were born with your skin a different color than someone else's  why does that make you special? Maybe it's just because I think the concept of race is stupid (biologically speaking  it doesn't exist)  but i don't think your race should differentiate you from anyone else  for better or worse.

Right now  there's a kiosk at a store I frequent selling ""black art."" Some of it is African  some of it is art of significant black Americans  some of it is related to traditionally black fraternities and sororities. The only thing connecting these pieces of art is the color of the skin of the artist. Why does that matter?

"CMV:Most Christians today do not follow the religion of Jesus, but rather the religion of Saul of Tarsus","Early Christianity was far different than the version of Christianity that is followed today. As is the case when any work is passed through a vast shit-spinning bureaucratic system (as any government or corporate worker can attest!)  the message is often shaped into some Frankenstein monstrosity hardly resembling the original message at all.

Jesus viewed himself as a Jew. His sermons and critiques on the application of Mosaic Law in his day were meant for a Jewish audience - his brothers and sisters. He never had the intent to create a separate religion. He likely would be mortified to learn that his ministry evolved in such a manner. 

The earliest Christians still considered themselves to be Jewish. In fact  it was people like Saul of Tarsus that tried to quell the influence of this rising sect of Judaism through violent persecution. This persecution was so persistent that it essentially forced an evolution away from viewing themselves as Jews  but as something else altogether.

Jesus was anti-establishment. He railed against the corruption of the Rabbis and their obsession with the Law. He riled up the power structure so much in his little part of the world that they nailed him to tree and let him rot in public view like they did other dissidents.

Saul was about as pro-establishment as you could get - he was a zealot of the highest order. He felt his little worldview under attack by these new critics of the Law and zealously rounded them up to be imprisoned and executed in hopes that the threat to his religion would be quelled. Sound familiar? 

After Saul had his little stroke on the road to Damascus  he brought that zealotry to his newfound worldview and transformed it into something of a zombie worship cult. 

Saul's theology became such a large part of the nascent religion that his thoughts and theories eventually were selected to become one of the largest portions of the canonized sacred texts (by another council of zealots). 

So instead of the religion of peace  empathy and acceptance  we are often left with a religion of paranoia and righteousness and exclusion. 

Jesus's Philosophy:

* Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart  and with thy whole soul  and with thy whole mind  and with thy whole strength;

* Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

When Jesus says: ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.""  in my view  Jesus meant that by following his way of compassion  one would find God.

Saul took this to mean something else entirely  and thus the concept of ""Salvation"" was born.

Saul's Philosophy:
E. P. Sanders finds three major emphases in Paul's writings:[8]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle

* His strongest emphasis was on the death  resurrection  and lordship of Jesus Christ. He preached that one's faith in Jesus assures that person a share in Jesus' life (salvation). He saw Jesus' death as being for the believers' benefit  not a defeat. Jesus died so that believers' sins would be forgiven.

* The resurrection of Jesus was of primary importance to Paul  as may be seen in his first letter to the Thessalonians[1 Thes. 1:9-10] which is the earliest surviving account of Paul's conversion.

* The resurrection brought the promise of salvation to believers. Paul taught that  when Christ returned  those who had died believing in Christ as the saviour of mankind would be brought back to life  while those still alive would be ""caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air"".[1 Thes. 4:14-18]

Rather than focusing on the LIFE (his message  etc.) of Jesus as a solution for life's problems  Saul created this fixation on the DEATH of Jesus as a solution.

Christians today fully subscribe to Pauline Doctrine of salvation through Christ as some kind of pill to be taken  often to the exclusion of Jesus' true message. Thus  we get the likes of the KKK  homophobic pizzerias and war-mongering politicians invoking the name of Jesus to explain actions and ideology that are antithetical to Jesus. 

EDIT: Thanks for the lively discussion! This has been an interesting conversation. While I don't feel that my view has completely changed  many of you have provided insight that has me interested to revisit the topic and re-read Paul's letters to compare to Jesus' teachings once more. Thanks!

"CMV: If atheists held the same standards of evidence to their lack of faith as they do to religion, most atheists would be agnostic instead of atheist","I have heard many atheists explain that they don't believe in any God because there is a lack of evidence that a god exists.  A common response religious people have is that atheists have no evidence that God doesn't exist either.  Which I think is a fair point. I concede that most major religions seem to be riddled with paradoxes and seemingly impossible stories if you take everything literally  but I think it's not necessary to take everything literally to be a true believer  and I don't think the workings of religion matter to this discussion besides the fundamental belief that the is a God (or multiple.)  

After all  a belief by definition is something you hold regardless of evidence. So it's fine to say you think God probably doesn't exist  but atheists *believe* God doesn't exist. I don't think that's a scientific conclusion at all.

I don't think we can prove that God isn't real any more than we can prove that God *is* real.  So atheism  the belief that there is no God  is just as much a leap in faith as believing in a  God.  It's like Schrodinger's Cat  which can't be proven either dead or alive  so we say either could be true and don't assume either one.  The same should be true for God. We can't prove whether God exists or not  so I believe atheists who base their lack of belief on science should be agnostic without any evidence for their atheism  or else they are being hypocritical.  

I just want to mention that I don't mean to offend anyone regardless of their beliefs  but I think currently the logical and scientific view of all this should be agnosticism.  Please change my view

Edit:  Thanks for helping to change my view  I learned a lot from reading your replies.  Apparently my definitions of atheism and agnosticism were incomplete.

"CMV: How do voter ID laws discriminate against a certain group of people, such as blacks or hispanics? To me that seems extremely illogical.","There is one law (for example  you need to register to vote early and you need to have a photo ID from the state)  and this applies to everyone. Yet often people claim this ""targets minority voters""  even recently an appeals judge ruled that texas' law did just that. How? How does a law that has the same requirements of everyone discriminate? Doesn't the implication that it hurts minority voters indicate that people A) think black people and hispanics are incapable of having a license (for some reason) and B) are not as good at planning and can't just go online and register to vote in advance (also ridiculous).

EDIT: So essentially  what I have gotten from all of the comments and conversations is that the laws themselves are not inherently discriminatory (which was my original issue)  but that decisions made by certain people who implemented the laws (including shutting down particular offices  cutting hours open  or only accepting particular forms of ID) are a discrimination issue. So  in a vacuum  everyone seems to agree this is certainly a poverty problem and *not* a race problem. But  due to other actions by representatives  and various pieces of evidence  it has become one. Which I can accept. Thank you everyone that voiced their opinions. While I still *hate* making things about race when they don't have to be  I can agree that some of the additional actions were indeed discriminatory

CMV: Trump could go back on almost all of his campaign promises and still retain the support of most of his supporters,"Before the election  many Trump supporters said that they supported him for his policies not his personality. I don't think that is true. Since the election  he seems to have struggled to get anything done even with about as favourable a situation a President could have.

He's argued for healthcare changes that takes insurance away from people despite promising to do the opposite. He's gotten the US more involved in Syria despite promising the opposite. He has claimed credit for keeping jobs in the US that were never going to leave and creating jobs that were already planned. He decided the low unemployment figures were real when he won the election. He claimed to ""drain the swamp"" then gave his family important jobs. He said Obama was wrong to use executive orders then did so. He still seems to be trusted by his supporters. Likewise  when he argued that Obama wiretapped him  I thought that Trump supporters would find a way to believe him. They did.

I think that Trump could do the exact same things as Obama and effectively do no actual work but as long as he offends the left and minorities  he will retain the support of >80% of his current supporters as the media they watch and their own bias will convince them that everything is getting better and Trump is doing a great job.

What would CMV is proof that Trump's support is down to his policies and not his behaviour and that his support is capable of changing their minds and will not follow him blindly.

"CMV: There was a child who was deaf in my showing of Jurassic Park. He was very noisy. I don't believe he should have gone to the movies, and I think it would have been okay if he were kicked out for being a disturbance.","There was a younger child who was deaf at my showing of Jurassic Park. He was constantly making loud ""woo-ing"" noises throughout the entire movie  being quite the disturbance. *Edit: He may have another disability as well  it was difficult to tell. Deafness was the only apparent one.* Much of the audience was clearly uncomfortable  but didn't want to ask his guardians or someone from the theater to get him to leave. I was having quite the moral dilemma about it  I didn't ask either  so I'm not saying that anyone was in the wrong about staying quiet.

Perhaps he shouldn't have been at the movie to begin with because of the graphic nature of the film  but that wouldn't have been enough to ask him to leave. 

So  change my view. Even though this child had a clear disability and the disability is why he was being a disturbance  it should be okay for him to be kicked out without repercussion.

Things I do still believe: his guardians/parents should have quieted him or had him leave  ~~but he shouldn't have been kicked out of the movie.~~ If I had spoken to an usher  then the usher could have asked ~~him~~ *edit: his guardians* to be quiet  ~~but that's all I could have expected.~~ *Edit: maybe it would be okay for him to be removed still  struggling with this one.* *Edit: I shouldn't approach the guardians.* Otherwise I would expect to get a refund and go see the movie another time.

~~What a weird conclusion.~~

Without all of the strikethroughs/edits: ""his guardians/parents should have quieted him or had him leave. If I had spoken to an usher  then the usher could have asked his guardians to be quiet. Maybe it would be okay for him to be removed still  I'm struggling with this part still. I shouldn't approach the guardians. Otherwise I would expect to get a refund and go see the movie another time.

* Is his time & enjoyment more valuable than the rest of the moviegoer's combined?
* What are arguments against him going to a time dedicated to children/families  a time with significantly less viewers  or some other method of viewing that wouldn't have caused a disturbance to others? 

#Irrelevant at this point:

* I know I can ask the manager for a refund and/or leave. That doesn't address my view  or change it.

#Update:

At this point  I will only respond to those I feel like are making a good case or I want more information from. I highly encourage continued posting  I am reading absolutely everything and genuinely interested in what people are saying.

"CMV: Planning to have a home birth is selfish, as it increases the risk of death for the baby. Yet, the baby has no saying in this matter.","I had a number of friends with delivery horror stories. Some of them started well  but all of sudden something went wrong. In one case the mother needed blood transfusion  in another the baby needed to be intubated. In both cases  the additional time that would take to transfer them to the hospital could mean the difference between life and death.

This is why I am not surprised by research results  like the one cited in the link below saying that the risks of death for the infant are 2.4 times higher. I have seen other research results that point to even more drastic differences.

I understand that being in a hospital sucks. My wife had very complicated deliveries and for our first child we ended up spending months at a NICU. So we know well how much it sucks to be in a hospital environment.

That said  I really do not think that being in the comfort of your own home trumps  in any way  the increased risks incurred in delivering a baby at home  as opposed to at a hospital.",276,4,4,18,21,"[['[source](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=nl&v=29).'], ['https://www.bellybelly.com.au/birth/highest-c-section-rates-by-country/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2742137/'], ['meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4399594/)'], ['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4399594/)'], ['background](http://amimckay.com/books/the-birth-house/midwifery-in-the-1900s/)', 'perspective](http://birthstorymovie.com/the-film/)', 'birth""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nchdf1ehhgc)'], ['http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1501738'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['http://www.cochrane.org/cd000352/preg_benefits-and-harms-of-planned-hospital-birth-compared-with-planned-home-birth-for-low-risk-pregnant-women'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['https://www.npr.org/series/543928389/lost-mothers'], ['abused.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/somatic-psychology/201201/the-foster-care-system-and-its-victims-part-2)""'], ['https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/01/cesarean-section-childbirth/'], ['study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4399594/)'], ['https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/where-can-i-give-birth.aspx'], ['source](https://evidencebasedbirth.com/what-is-the-evidence-for-pushing-positions/)'], ['[source](http://americanpregnancy.org/labor-and-birth/epidural/)']]",1,82,1,Yes
CMV: Access to early voting should be mandated across all 50 states,"It is without a doubt in my mind that early voting makes the voting process more convenient for citizens and creates a stronger democracy. It also diversifies the electorate  as has been seen nationwide where a large number of Latino and black voters have decided to partake in early voting. Early voting is now an essential part of the democratic process of the USA.

On the other hand  forcing citizens to spend significant time in line  sometimes up to several hours  on a single day of the year (a Tuesday of all fucking days) is irresponsible of the state  and borderline criminal. There are plenty of people who simply cannot make the time to go to the polls. Citizens in the following seven states are only given a 12 hour window to cast a vote for the president of their country. 

Alabama

Connecticut

Delaware

Michigan

New Hampshire

Pennsylvania

Rhode Island

We are no longer in the days of the 1700s  our laws and policies need you adopt to current and future needs.

Please change my view.

Edit: to be clear I am referring to in-person early voting. These are polling stations that are open 7 days a week and are usually held in the 2 to 4 weeks before election day.

CMV: Newspapers should have to maintain certain factual standards to be classed as news outlets.,"In the UK  we do have an Independent Press Standards Organisation  but it is ineffective and several news organisations have opted out.

I strongly believe that the lack of accuracy  sensationalism and propaganda spread by newspapers (especially those like the Daily Mail and the Sun) is a massively damaging force in society. The Daily Mail is the most read paper in the UK  but frequently misrepresents facts and uses this to fuel hatred (and recently - borderline fascism). And people believe what they read - the majority of people don't have the time or desire to cross-reference articles from different sources to piece together what might be the truth. It's not defensible to allow opinion to masquerade as news simply when 23 million people are ingesting it. I should add here that I'm not simply disagreeing because they hold a different political opinion to me - but for instance  I have a law degree  and the Mail often gets basic law wrong. The Guardian has definitely fallen guilty of this too (in the recent Ched Evans case).

The best way I see to combat this is a more vigilant watchdog organisation  and the clearest way to send a damning message about the quality of papers would be to only allow newspapers which maintain a set standard of factual accuracy to classify and market themselves as 'newspapers'  with the remaining ones lowered to something along the lines of 'magazines'  'entertainment papers'  or other options - I am definitely open to other labels. 

I don't particularly want to argue about how they can judge factual accuracy - press watchdogs all over manage to do this  and obviously there would be enough leeway granted not to frighten journalists into failing to publish reports out of fear of being sued. I don't think this would stifle freedom of expression. 

Ultimately  this would send a clear message to the public about the quality and accuracy of the information they rely on. It would allow readers to make an informed choice about where they get their news  and would hopefully result in newspapers drastically upping their standards of journalism.",93,1,1,5,8,"[['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyoofrog1em'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['http://photographyisnotacrime.com', 'https://photographyisnotacrime.com/2016/09/19/connecticut-state-police-sued-after-caught-on-camera-plotting-to-fabricate-charges-against-open-carry-activist/', 'https://photographyisnotacrime.com/2016/10/30/ohio-sheriff-sued-after-video-he-tried-to-destroy-surfaces-showing-deputy-pepper-spraying-restrained-woman/', 'https://photographyisnotacrime.com/2016/10/28/watch-award-winning-pennsylvania-cops-sued-for-brutal-arrest-thanks-to-video-they-tried-to-destroy/'], ['permitted.](http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment1/annotation09.html)'], ['article](http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/)']]",0,18,1,Yes
CMV: GoFundMe and similar services are the internet equivalent of panhandling and should be actively discouraged and socially unacceptable.,"It seems like nearly every day I'm seeing a new post on my facebook feed asking me to donate to someone's friend. I see Today I Fucked Up posts on reddit with comments suggesting that they set up gofundme pages and ask for donations. 

No one would ever suggest these people go hold a sign up on the side of the road  but posting a request for donations online is totally acceptable.

When did it become socially acceptable to ask friends and strangers to fix your financial mistakes? Do these people feel no shame in telling the world that they have poor plannings skills  can't provide for themselves  don't know how to manage money or make sound decisions  or do we just not care about that anymore?

I'm not against charity or welfare. I'm a huge proponent of the social safety net and associated programs. But that's not what's being asked for here. I've got people asking for money to cover their move into a new apartment. Someone posted that their water heater broke and they need 5 grand to fix it - that sucks  but you won't die if you have to ask a family member to use their shower for a few days while you secure a loan. Today someone posted about stupidly giving $27k in cash to a friend to pay for a funeral and getting ripped off - that's terrible  but there are other solutions to that problem that don't require begging for money.

What's worse is that in all these situations  they just want a handout. I'd be at least a little more understanding if gofundme offered a method of arranging microloans. At least there would be some semblance of responsibility and intent to return the money.",243,0,0,3,5,"[['expenses](https://qz.com/index/1006412/crowdfunding-health-services-almost-half-of-the-money-raised-through-gofundme-went-to-medical-campaigns/).'], ['[barn-raising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barn_raising).', 'expense](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/most-americans-cant-afford-a-500-emergency-expense/)', 'parties""](https://www.thespruce.com/green-home-renovation-style-1821822),'], ['[mircolending](https://www.kiva.org/)?']]",0,51,0,Yes
CMV: The Zero Tolerance laws in schools and aimed at youth specifically are absolutely ridiculous and should mostly be changed.,"Kids getting suspended for sunscreen

kids getting jailtime and having scholarships removed just for drinking a beer

kids getting CPS called on them for going outside without their parents at a young age 

kids not being allowed to hang out in most public spaces without getting harassed by police 

kids getting expelled for fighting even when they are being beaten up

kids getting suspended or expelled for things as minor as cutting class or cursing in high school

extremely harsh penalties for drug laws  especially aimed at kids. 

I dont even need to keep going  you guys get the gist. We have demonized and sheltered and essentially imprisoned our kids to be as perfect as possible in every possible way  making sure that they do absolutely no wrong in any way  or else the punishments will be EXTREME. This is actually inspired by another CMW post in which the commenters described how kids are raised today  essentially in constant fear of getting in trouble in even the smallest ways. It absolutely astounded me  some of the things they said  it made me ill to think about. Kids need to have freedom and take risks. Kids aren't even fucking leaving their house anymore because of how oppressive their environments are (according to the counselor who made that post at least). 

This seems to be a very uniquely USA/UK thing  and it seems to be generational. Baby boomers simply do not understand the idea of tolerance when it comes to getting in trouble. When I grew up in the 1990s  we got into all kinds of mild-trouble  and you know what?  We fucking loved it  and it created memories of my childhood that I will cherish forever. When cops caught us drinking they asked us to pour it out and that was it. When teachers saw someone fighting they broke up the fight and gave the kids a warning. We could actually hang out on the streets for hours on end with dozens of other kids socializing and walking around the hood and nobody cared. It seems as if this is becoming a thing of the past because kids are so unbelievably terrified of getting into trouble. 

Edit: I forgot to add the last part of my post

Back in the day we used to go into abandoned buildings and hang out  have block parties with friends  have rooftop parties  drink in public occasionally in hidden spots  hang out in groups and shit. And all of us ended up fine. Today? I cant even IMAGINE this shit happening anymore. Cops would be there in a second  or some 'concerned' old person would call in hysterics screaming ""KIDS ARE HAVING FUN  GET OVER HERE FAST!!"" 

This post is also partially inspired by a group of 3 kids who were biking down my block and some old yuppie lady went up to them and started harassing them and saying ""what are you doing here  why are you here  why are you not at home? who just bikes around like this? you should all go home before I call the cops"". This right there is a perfect example of the type of culture I am talking about.

CMV: It makes no sense to allow Gun Manufacturers to be sued for crimes committed with their products.,"What exactly is the reasoning behind this stance? I haven't seen anyone actually present an argument for it  except to make appeals to emotion. It simply doesn't compute that manufacturers producing a legal product legally could somehow be at fault for illegal applications of their legal product. This is like allowing car companies to be sued for the damages caused by drunk drivers using their products. It just seems moronic in my eyes.

So  change my view.

Remember that the downvote button is not an I disagree button.

CMV: Corporations almost never act in the interest of the public and would pursue extremely unethical and illegal practices to increase profits if not prevented from doing so by government regulations.,"My view: Corporations almost never act in the interests of the public  and often inflict great damage upon society and the environment in order to maximize profits  and must be regulated in order to protect the public. For instance  Volkswagen emission-testing controversy. Their recent vehicles have been found to be fitted with a mechanism that is able to detect that the vehicle is being emission tested  and switch the engine to an ultra low emission  high efficiency mode to pass the tests. When the vehicle was not being tested  the engine switched back to a higher performance but also far dirtier fuel burning configuration. This is a prime example of a company knowingly harming the environment for the purpose of increasing profit. There are countless other examples of other corporations participating in unethical and often harmful behaviors to increase profits and please the shareholders.

"CMV: If gender is a social construct, then so is race","Let us take  as a given  that gender is divorced from the circumstances of your birth  that it is not a mental illness  and that there is no biological basis for what gender identity someone should express. Have I phrased that effectively? I'm trying to be concise  but I want to portray that premise correctly.

Why  then  should race be different than gender? If race carries with it ""shared experience"" and ""lived experience""  etc - that assumes that the only way you could understand what it's like to be a minority is to have lived your entire life as that particular minority. I'm not arguing against that  I agree that there are certain experiences that I could not comprehend - for instance  overbearing & strict Asian parents with exceedingly high expectations. 

But  if someone can change their gender or decide (?) that they identify as a different gender without having the prior lived experience of said gender  then why can't someone identify as a different race?

I'm not able to encompass all the variables which could lead someone to identify as another gender  but is it not possible for someone to come to the same conclusion with their race? What if an Indian man grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood  saw or experienced the same (or similar) discrimination as them  had minimal exposure to Indian culture; and this led him to conclude that he identifies more closely as a black man  rather than Indian? 

I would also like to cite Rachel Dolezal  who was uniformly mocked for being (afaik) the first trans-black woman in the public eye. It seems similar to transgender discrimination to me  assuming that there is something wrong with her mentally for deciding to become a black woman... Anyway  I'm not really defending her because that's not really in line with what I described in the previous paragraph (she grew up privileged IIRC)  but the public reaction of mockery goes against the leftist belief of acceptance  by my perspective.

So  in short  why can there be no such thing as trans-racial people  the same way there are transgender?

CMV: Democrats are woefully terrible at branding.,"When I think of political phrases that have stuck in my lifetime  they all come from republicans.  Things like  ""Fake News""  ""Death Panels""  and ""Death Tax"".  They even seem to co-opt entire idiologies  like being pro-military  despite democrats pushing for wars at least as much while in power and usually actually fighting for the rights of veterens.

Democrats never seem to be able to do this  and instead try to use the same phrases against them.  Like saying  ""What Trump just said is fake news.""  The problem with that is by using the phrase  they strengthen it.

The closest I can think of a democrat successfully branding anything was Obama branding ""Hope and Change"".  Problem with that is that only works before he got in office.  What he really provided was stability  which was great  but it wasn't revolutionary change.  I believe this opened the door for Trump to pretend to be a ""real agent for change"" (when really he's just an agent for instability).

It's hard to say why this is.  Is it because well-paid marketing guys are often republican?

In any case  it is a serious problem.  Americans respond to marketing.  This is a proven fact.  And democrats are terrible at it.

Anybody who has taken up smoking tobacco since the year 1990 has made a proundly stupid decision and has nobody to blame but themselves. CMV.,"**Background:** I'm a 21 year old from Ontario  Canada. My exposure to smoking tobacco is as follows. I grew up in a time when it was common knowledge that smoking was terrible. My entire childhood I was told by family members  teachers  and even television that smoking tobacco is awful and I should never  ever do it. Every year at elementary school in health and physical education there was a brief unit on the dangers of addictive drugs  and tobacco was usually one of the first items up for discussion. We would have to complete assignments and presentations to prove our understanding of the risks. So my personal decision to never take up smoking in my life seems like a no-brainer.

The usual argument I hear from people who defend smoking is that the addiction is nearly impossible to combat  and smoking brings them much relief. Well  those people have already made up their minds and I support their freedom to do what they want with their own lives. (as long as it's not invading my personal airspace)

What I don't understand is why anybody less than a few years older than me would ever make the decision to get started in the first place. A few decades ago  smoking was not something that anybody questioned. But in recent times  I can't imagine how anybody is not painfully aware of the consequences. I don't think you can claim ignorance and shrug off starting smoking as ""just something to do"" in this day and age.

**To change my view:** Explain what convinces a person under 25 in North America  or anywhere the problems associated with tobacco are well known  to get into smoking *in the first place.* I don't see what could outweigh all of the lifelong influence against it.

"CMV: The term ""Sexual Assault"" is far too broad to be meaningful, and statistics regarding sexual assault drastically inflate the problem by conflating an unwanted kiss with rape","I think when most people hear the term ""Sexual Assault"" they automatically assume rape. When statistics for sexual assault on campuses are referenced in the media they almost always cite frequency of sexual assault  then go on to discuss issues around rape. There is so much difference between coming on strong and rape that having one term to describe them both is confusing at best and often deliberately disingenuous to make the problem seem much more prevalent than it is. I don't think rape isn't an issue  and I'm not saying that everything up to penetration is fine. I do think that the surveys used to create these statistics are so broad with their definition of ""sexual assault"" as to be meaningless  and that we need to rethink how we define it if we want people who aren't already on board with fighting ""rape culture"" to take it seriously. It's a lot like lumping marijuana in with heroine and saying all drugs are bad. When someone tries marijuana and finds it to not be a big deal  they're less likely to take your word when you say that heroine is dangerous because drugs=bad.

CMV: No one has any idea on how to prevent spree killings. Everyone is supporting measures that have no supporting evidence.,"The current solutions offered by talking heads  celebrities  and politicians won't actually do anything to stop spree killings.

The common metric is to define a mass killing as any shooting of four or more people   which disregards circumstance. So a gang shooting in Chicago would be counted as well as the Orlando shooting despite the circumstances surrounding both shootings.

That being said  the spree killings I am referring to are the mass shootings where the shooter has some kind of political/religious motive i.e. San Bernadino shooting or some kind of behavioral issue (which is not to say a mental illness) i.e. Adam Lanza or James Holmes.

Currently the ideas floated around I see as either complete nonsense or woefully impractical.

Expanded Background checks: how would that have stopped any spree killers? Most if not all haven't had any run ins with law enforcement. 

Ban assault weapons: this would only create a black market for weapons that  without heavy use  would last for decades. Meaning any ban would have to last for fifty years to see any significant change. Which is not going to ever happen. Lets say that this did happen  to make any effect in the short term you would need to confiscate from everyone   which would also never happen.

Arm Everyone/remove gun free zones: there were three extra duty officers onsite at Pulse  this still happened. I am only saying that even trained and armed officers were not a significant deterrent nor the solution to taking down an active shooter.  You would have had to have guards or armed citizens right next to the shooter to make any kind of difference. Which lacking any kind of advance intelligence is hardly a realistic or practical method of dealing with active shooters. Just fill public places with armed guards? Isn't that the police state everyone is so afraid of? Require training for concealed carry (CC) permit holders and then just hope that some are in the area?  Outside of the legal challenges regarding the  ""shall not be infringed"" part of the 2nd amendment   what would that effective training look like? There is no good way of implementing either plan. Its a pipe dream.

More regulation: what does this even mean?

CMV: There is no real way of preventing this type of violence given any currently proposed solution  only to survive it.

Edit: This has been educational  but I feel most lines of thought are now just running in circles. I was hoping that I was just being cynical and that someone would propose a new solution or take one of the above solutions and show how proper implementation could work.

"CMV: Christianity is used as a way to justify pre-existing moral beliefs, not as a source of them.","This argument will be specific to Christianity  although I do think it likely applies to other religions. However  I don't know enough about other religions to have a meaningful conversation  so please keep your arguments focused on Christianity. This is also specific to Christians who claim the Bible is the word of God. I am aware that some Christians believe the Bible is the word of people  and their reflections and thoughts on God.

There are several reasons I think Christianity is not a source of most of it's practitioners beliefs  but instead is used as a form of confirmation bias to support beliefs they already hold. These reasons are: Bible verses that get ignored  how it is determined when books are added to the Bible  and how Christianity changes over time with society.

My first point is that people often cherry pick Bible verses. I know that this is pointed out often on change my view and gets tiring  so I'm not going to post examples. I also know that this differs across denominations and that Bible verses are open to interpretation  but in my opinion this actually supports my point. People choose Bible verses to argue beliefs they hold outside of the Bible. If a person believed the Bible was the word of God  why would they pick out specific things from it to believe? To me  it's clear that people don't believe in things such as harsh punishments and not eating shellfish because society no longer cares about those things. However  people do have very strong views about  for example  homosexuality and claim these views are because of the Bible  while simultaneously ignoring other verses of the Bible. This  to me  shows that people are not generally interested in learning from the Bible  but moreso using the Bible to support internal beliefs they can't find support for elsewhere.

They second point I mentioned was about how books get added to the Bible. This applies specifically to Catholics because I'm getting this information from the Catholic school I went to. However  the general methodology for deciding which books to add to the Bible I think applies to probably all denominations. Sometimes  people apparently find books that they think should be added to the Bible and whether or not they get added is determined by what people think about God. This information about God comes from the currently used form of the Bible. Why are we using the Bible to determine what other books should be added to the Bible if the Bible already says contradictory things about God? My view is that it isn't the Bible we use to decide what books get added  it's our own preconceived ideas about what ""good"" is  and since God is good  we ourselves use our ideas of good to decide what God does  not the other way around.

Finally  society changes all the time  and Christianity changes with it. Before  Christians used to believe gay people were evil  now it's just that they are sinning. We also used to believe in very serious punishments for what we now consider minor crimes. We used to be ok with slavery  and in fact  the Bible tells how slaves should act. But as society changes  so to do the teachings of Churches. To me  this is evidence that people don't get their beliefs from God  they define God's beliefs based in their own. Change my view.

Edit: Thank you guys for all the responses. I just wanted to clarify a few things.

1. I hold no animosity towards Christians in general. I have many Christian friends who I consider to be very intelligent. I will say that this is primarily because they see it as more of the experience and deciding for yourself what an all wise all good God would be like. They don't believe God himself had a direct influence on the writing of the Bible  only that it was written about him by people.

2. I'm already aware the purpose of Jesus was to invalidate the New Testament  or render its rules unnecessary. This kind of also proves my point on a more macro scale. As far as I'm aware  Jews and Christians believe in the same God  but Christians believe the messiah was found. The entire religion of Christianity was founded by a guy who thought those regulations were outdated and got rid of them. And also  why would an infinitely wise God have to change his mind about which rules are necessary?",200,1,1,7,13,"[['1800s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_great_awakening)'], ['https://www.redeemer.com/redeemer-report/article/old_testament_law_and_the_charge_of_inconsistency'], ['empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_ancient_rome)', 'wilberforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_wilberforce).', 'throughout](http://www.kean.edu/~njhpp/americanrevolution/quakers/documents/quakersdoc1.pdf),', '[abolition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_views_on_slavery#christian_abolitionism).'], [""peterson's](https://www.youtube.com/user/jordanpetersonvideos)"", '[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5_-pfqfgji)', '[some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8goxcntqgos&)', '[ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwcvletrbjg&t=150s).'], ['zealous](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/zeal_of_the_convert)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+13)).']]",0,35,0,Yes
"CMV: Impeachment of President Trump would not actually solve any problems, but rather cause more since VP Mike Pence would be President.","I'm informed  but not as informed as I'd like to be. I've seen a lot of awful things about Pence; what he believes and what bills he has and hasn't supported. From what I've gathered  it seems as if Pence would be even worse than Trump. Granted  I'm not a Trump supporter either. I was in the beginning  and became """"""""neutral"""""""" not long after. 
If somebody who is more informed than me could explain if Pence would be worse than Trump  or if its the other way around  I could possibly be on board with the impeachment idea. Until then  I don't really have an opinion on it.
Basically  would Pence as President cause more issues?
I understand his position on LGBQT+ rights is not a friendly one. I know Trump's opinion isn't much different  but Pence seems much more aggressive towards the topic. Perhaps aggressive enough to challenge it completely. 
I know I'm bad at explaining  but I would like to see what everyone thinks. 

Edit 1: I posted this late last night  so I wasn't able to think of everything I wanted to add. My apologies. I understand that for a President to be impeached  they have to commit treason  bribery  or anything else astronomical. I understand that a President can not be impeached based off the public disliking or disagreeing with them. I apologize if my OG post came off that way!

Edit 2: I should have added that from what has happened the past week or two  it seems as if Pence was involved with the Comey scandal. I think it's safe to assume he was also involved with the President giving Russia confidential information  right?

"CMV:If Supreme Court Justices actually did what they were supposed to do, virtually every decision would be a 9-0 vote. The fact that many votes - especially on ""hot button"" issues - are 5-4 votes indicates that the Justices are deciding politically, rather than simply interpreting the Constitution","[This](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/06/01/so-much-for-politics-more-than-half-of-supreme-court-decisions-unanimous/) is somewhat dated information  but it generally speaks to my point.  Even though that article's overall view counters my view  it states:

> With 58 decisions in so far  30  or 52%  have been 9-0 votes  well above the 30% in 2007 and the five-year average of 39% for unanimous opinions. Another 12% were 8-1  compared with a five-year average of 10%. In all  87% of the decisions so far have garnered more consensus than the 5-4 split usually associated with conservative decisions in the court run by Chief Justice John Roberts. The five-year average for 5-4 votes is 24%.

While the Constitution is certainly an ambiguous document if you're looking for ambiguity  it isn't really that complex and is generally straight forward.  And it should be especially straight forward to the greatest legal minds in the country (if we are able to assume that that group includes the Supreme Court Justices).

So  if all the Justices are doing is interpreting the Constitution and telling us what it means  there should be very little dissension.  Virtually every vote should be 9-0  with a few 8-1 decisions thrown in.  A 5-4 decision should be virtually unheard of.

Having so many votes that are *not* 9-0  indicates that the Justices are either (a) not very good at interpreting the Constitution (i.e.  they aren't really qualified for the job) or (b) they are basing their votes upon their own personal and/or political opinions  rather than an interpretation of the Constitution.",342,3,4,17,27,"[['question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/begging_the_question)'], ['year](http://www.supremecourt.gov/faq.aspx#faqgi9).'], ['interpretation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_interpretation)'], ['madison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marbury_v._madison).'], ['shown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plessy_v._ferguson)', 'case.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_v._board_of_education)'], ['[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_v._lopez).'], ['joined](http://supreme-court-cases.findthebest.com/d/c/elena-kagan)'], ['(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/certiorari#federal_courts),'], ['http://www.scotusblog.com/reference/educational-resources/supreme-court-procedure/)'], ['jacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohen_v._california).)', 'speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snyder_v._phelps).)'], ['states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyllo_v._united_states),'], ['monsanto](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bowman-v-monsanto-co/)', 'petroleum](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kiobel-v-royal-dutch-petroleum/)', 'steel](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sandifer-v-united-states-steel-corporation/)'], ['(.pdf)](http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1851&context=facpub)'], ['it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_foreign_intelligence_surveillance_court)'], ['language](http://books.google.com/books?id=mcy-aaaacaaj&printsec=frontcover&dq=dictionary+english&hl=en&sa=x&ei=k2w-u969cvsosqs3locada&ved=0ceyq6aewaa#v=onepage&q=regulate&f=false)', 'meant""](http://books.google.com/books?id=mcy-aaaacaaj&printsec=frontcover&dq=dictionary+english&hl=en&sa=x&ei=k2w-u969cvsosqs3locada&ved=0ceyq6aewaa#v=onepage&q=militia&f=false)'], ['[w-54](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w54)', 'think](http://brainshavings.com/the-right-to-keep-and-bear-what/)'], ['[regular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regular_army)', '[irregular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irregular_military)', '[militia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/militia)', 'confederation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/articles_of_confederation),', '1792](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/militia_acts_of_1792).']]",1,114,3,Yes
"CMV: In the Internet age, a true democracy should allow all constituents to vote on issues online weekly/monthly","In the wake of the massive turnout for the Scottish Referendum  I think the way to get people to re-engage with politics is by passing weekly or monthly referendums on smaller topics.

Voting could be via a YouGov style portal  at special postboxes at the post office  via text or even the 'red button' on TV *(edit: or by phone)*

If this came into effect people would be empowered to make their opinions known on a wide range of policy and make an actual difference rather than just voting for a career politician every 5 years and hoping they don't develop differing opinions within that term.

Voting would be mandatory unless you either opted-out of particular issues or informed the service in advance.

So change my view that this would be a much  much more democratic process that the current one.

Often times when you see videos of suspects resisting arrest  the officers have a very difficult controlling them.  Usually  these struggles look like evenly matched fights with the officer having no skill advantage.   A police officer  someone who arrests people on a daily basis  should have the training to subdue an untrained civilian without risking getting their ass kicked in the process.  

I personally know three police officers.  None of them regularly participate in any form of hand-to-hand training.  All three of them regularly practice shooting.  None of them have had to shoot a suspect  yet all of them have had to go hands-on with a suspect.  Their approach to training seems counterintuitive. 

TL;DR cops should be able to fight.  cops should be able to easily arrest most people.  

edit: This is a discussion about training to develop skills  not a discussion about the utilization of those skills.  I don't think most of the comment are actually arguing with my point.  Saying ""cops should avoid grappling"" is not an argument against receiving training for the instances with grappling is unavoidable.  Saying something along the lines of ""it would cost too much money to give cops regular training"" is an argument against receiving training.

CMV:Jailing someone for the inability to pay a bail bond is a form of debtors imprisonment and should be illegal,"In America  debtors imprisonment was made illegal some time ago; US courts decided that being sent to prison because one is unable to reimburse a loan to a private company is unlawful. Now a days Bail Bonds originate from the government as courts but pass though private companies that specialize on the repayment of those bonds. Even though there is no loan that needs to be paid off  wouldn't holding someone in a cell for any amount of time because they can't pay off a bail be illegal under the logic of debtors imprisonment?

CMV:people will only take climate change seriously once a lot of people die,"i believe the only way climate change will be taken seriously will be when thousands of people will die

1)climate change is considered an ""invisible force""  that is there are few physical signs that show that the Earth's climate is changing. the only physical signs will be through natural disasters (hurricanes  floods  droughts). no matter how many times a scientist will go on the news to say climate change is real  people won't change the way they live their lives. 

2)relating to the first point the amount of these natural disasters need to happen frequently. for example  hurricane sandy caused 65 million dollars of damages and occurred in late October. yet climate deniers will say it was just a freak accident that occurs every couple decades or so. they will probably mention a powerful natural disaster in the 50s or so and say ""was climate change happening then??"" like a scrap on the knee  people will just put a band-aid over it and give it time to heal  but if these scraps happen in rapid session people will realize they can't take it anymore

3)people only care about things that affect them. if there was a law that made its citizens use environmental friendly trash bags and to recycle  they would flip out. why would people care that polar bears  dolphins  bees  etc. are dying?

"CMV: Its better to let a guilty man go free, than send an innocent man to jail.","This is the cornerstone of most justice systems  and I just want to see of anyone actually disagrees wth it. Lets say a women claims to be raped  but there is no evidence whatsoever other than her testimony. The man admits they both had sex  but claims that it was consensual. There are no witnesses  so its literally just the guy's word against the girl's. I say that the man should be set free  since no hard evidence exists to convict him.

The same can be said of many other crimes. The simple fact is that the United States convicts way too many innocent people. This list details every wrongfully convicted person in the United States:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wrongful_convictions_in_the_United_States

The UK had a major scandal where mothers were convicted of killing their children  when in fact they died of natural causes. Here is one such example:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Clark

The worst possible effect of innocent people being convicted is when they are sentenced to death. Here is a list of exonerated death row inmates form around teh world. Note that the US has the most exonerations:

Even among all exonerations the US still exonerates so many people  that Wikipedia had to create an entire separate article for them. Here is a list of exonerations around the world:

"CMV: I believe ""baby boomers"" had it incredibly easy and we (20-30 year olds) are now suffering as a result of their mistakes/advantage taking.","I honestly believe that people in my age group are stuffed. Listen  I realize that there are people in my age group doing very well for themselves and I also realize many baby boomers are doing poorly (for those who don't know  baby boomers are those born roughly between 1945-1965 which covers most of our parents here).

I don't know much about the effect that the war had on economics or about any of the economic realities of the years between 1950-1980 but it seems to me that growing up in that era was a lot easier. Sure  this is anecdotal  but everybody I know says the same. When I tell them that I struggle to find work (I haven't been properly employed since September  just part time/temp work) almost all my older relatives tell me about the good old days. My aunt walked into a teaching job in the 70's straight out of University and had a great career. Both my parents didn't go to University  walked into a company  and they're both retired aged 55 with 2 houses and 2 brand new Range Rovers (yes they did work incredibly hard and are the elite but you get what I mean).

It was [this](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/549/887/d0e.jpg) meme that made me think about posting this thread.

Obviously I understand that we have a lot of other things easier so I am not talking about things like access to Internet or entertainment. I am speaking strictly in terms of having the ability to lead an economically stable life (or I guess you could say  the ability to be somewhat self sufficient  independent and live the ""American Dream"").

After the 2008 crash  orchestrated in some sense by the baby boomer's greed  incompetence and carelessness  those of us who went to University/School in the past 10 years are double screwed. Add to this the constant creep of Governmental restrictions  control and bureaucracy (the government wants you to be more and more dependent on them  so they can control you and eat your money).

I'm not looking for hand outs or sympathy votes I just genuinely want to see arguments that I am wrong. I'm not sitting in my room blaming my elders (per se...) but I do feel some resentment when I see  for example  people in their fourties and fifites telling me that the world is my oyster and that my lack of a career 2 years after graduating is because I obviously ""don't want it enough"". 

CMV?

**EDIT**

I will try respond as best I can in time! Thank you for the posts so far  I have to think for a while. What I want to repeat is what someone in this thread already said. I think the entire point of my CMV post  or rather  my argument here is this:

The baby boomers ""made it for themselves"" but ""at the expense of the future"".


This is the root of the problem  why baby boomers are nicely comfortable in managerial positions that they secured at age 21 when you could walk into jobs  and now they have the attitude that anybody who can't do the same is a good for nothing rubbish. I believe the reality is that somewhere along the line greed kicked in (as it would post-war time) and whatever chance we had (20-30 year olds) has been snatched away from us.",284,2,5,21,45,"[['http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/'], ['jobs](http://seattlebusinessmag.com/business-corners/manufacturing/manufacturing-still-engine-economy).', 'graph](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/04/fredgraph-3.png).', 'now.](http://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2009/12/6/98115-126008279337711-john-lounsbury_origin.png)'], ['http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%e2%80%9375_recession#united_states', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis'], ['door](http://www.glassdoor.com/salary/caterpillar-salaries-e137.htm).'], ['plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan).'], ['**http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=real+gdp+per+capita+us+1960-2010'], ['http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ijtuxzore', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhpbdqcmnwq'], ['sure.](http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/citing+dangerous+personnel+failures+hagel+orders+full/9422131/story.html)', 'upgrade.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/world/europe/us-says-russia-tested-missile-despite-treaty.html)'], ['now](http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/06/12/every-generation-better-than-one-before-gen-x-could-buck-trend/)'], ['wage.](http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm)', '$3.35](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1207/7562.html)', '(http://www.census.gov/const/uspricemon.pdf)', 'out.](http://youtu.be/qpkkqnijnsm?t=4m41s)'], ['http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dklnk1mqiwg&b=4923193'], ['http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-kingriots-story,0,4609945.story'], ['wait](http://www.princetonreview.com/college/top-ten-majors.aspx)'], ['http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dklnk1mqiwg&b=4923193'], ['[this](http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/how-it%e2%80%99s-evolving/future-scenarios)'], ['http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/chapter-5/subchapter-ii', 'http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/202', 'https://www.eff.org/', 'law][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_common_law],', 'survival][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/systems_of_survival]', 'hill][http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/american-government-politics-and-policy/constituency-representation-congress-view-capitol-hill]'], ['nytimes.com', 'gop.com,', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/net_neutrality'], ['[here](http://useconomy.about.com/od/suppl1/f/real_unemployment_rate.htm)', '[here](http://www.businessinsider.com/almost-half-of-detroits-workers-are-unemployed-2009-12).', 'recessions](http://i242.photobucket.com/albums/ff90/avabrendan/mfgdecline.png).', 'experts](http://www.epi.org/publication/trading-manufacturing-advantage-china-trade/).'], ['about.com,', 'trade](http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/04/09/poole.pdf).', 'article](http://www.uscib.org/docs/china_services_study.pdf).', '[here](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.ca/2006/05/outsourcing-redux.html)', '[here](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-trade-developing-countries-3844.html)', '[here](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim).'], ['http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/03/democrats-introduce-open-internet-preservation-act-to-restore-net-neutrality/', 'http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/'], ['argument.](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?tritesayingscomeinpairs)']]",1,126,2,Yes
CMV: Political Polarization appears to be killing progress on pretty much every issue and we are doomed if we don't reverse course,"I strongly believe that the way we have become so polarized political is a huge threat to the American Experiment. Here are my assumptions 
1.Sexual assault is evil.
2.Consent laws are a wonderful idea because puberty doesn't mean that individuals are ready to even comprehend sex and the ramifications. 
3.Regardless of political party or preference towards a person  people who have promoted the endangerment of kids  or have confessed to doing so themselves should be considered gross and be called out on their actions.
4.No political side has a monopoly on having more terrible people or having the best people
5.People pretend their ""football team"" party is the greatest ever and can do no wrong.
6.Discourse dies and the less discourse there is  the less progress there is. Under Trump the polarization appears to have reached a new level.

So that's why I get mad that liberals will ignore Bill Maher and Lena Dunham but then Jump on Milo just because he is a safe target to attack. On the same token  many conservatives are quick to point out this hypocrisy as a way to give Milo a free pass on his terrible advocacy for the molestation of young boys. I strongly believe that polarization in the way we Milo is just as terrible as Lena Dunham  but that doesn't excuse Milo OR Lena Dunham. Both can be awful. They shouldn't get sainthood for being a member of your preferred political party. There are countless recent examples of this  executive orders  Wikileaks  Supreme Court nominations and the like. This one issue hits me me thinking about it a lot more but that's just a single example. 
the hardest as a child victim of sexual assault though.
 
Another example is different outlets calling out Bill Clinton or Trump for paling with convicted child sexual assaulter Jeff Epstien while COMPLETELY ignoring that the other person in the other side had a similar relationship and both flew on the ""Lolita Express"". 

It just feels like we are at a point where if your side does the exact same deplorable thing the other side does  instead of self accountability  one side excuses its dirty deeds by deferring to the other sides dirty deeds. It does seem to have gotten worse since Trump came along. It seems to be killing any hope of unity. I hope to God I am wrong about it.

My break is over  here is a link to me ranting further to provide more context. you don't have to speak to specific examples  just show me why polarization is GOOD.

CMV: There are only two genders.,"Just hear me out on what I have to say. I believe that there are two genders  male and female  and that they lie on opposite ends of a spectrum. Now  anyone can lie anywhere on the spectrum  but every gender should be based off of it's relation to one of the two. So you can be transgender  gender fluid  gender queer  all that goodness  but any gender not based off of male or female is made up by special snowflakes who want to be different and oppressed. 

I believe that a lot of people are also confusing gender with personality. One specific example I noticed was someone who identified as ""benegender"" a gender characterized by being calm and peaceful. What? That's not gender  that's personality. 

I do have a tough time understanding agender  I just can't grasp how you can be neither without being somewhere in the middle.

In conclusion:  
* I believe that there are two genders. You can be one  both  or somewhere in between  but they are all based off of the male/female genders.  
* I believe that gender =/= personality and gender should only be used to determine which sex people feel they are.

CMV: Criminalizing Holocaust denialism is restricting freedom of speech and shouldn't be given special treatment by criminalizing it. And criminalizing it essentially means we should also do apply the same to other unsubstantiated historical revisionism.,"Noam Chomsky has a point that Holocaust denialism shouldn't be silenced to the level of treatment that society is imposing to it right now. Of course the Holocaust happened and so on but criminalizing the pseudo-history being offered by Holocaust deniers is unwarranted and is restricting freedom of speech. There are many conspiracy theories and pseudo-historical books available to the public and yet we do not try to criminalize these. I do not also witness the same public rejection to comfort women denialism in Asia to the point of making it a criminal offense or at least placing it on the same level of abhorrence as Holocaust denialism. Having said that  I would argue that Holocaust denialism should be lumped into the category along the lines of being pseudo-history  unsubstantiated historical revisionism or conspiracy theories or whichever category the idea falls into but not into ones that should be banned and criminalize. If the pseudo-history/historical revisionism of Holocaust denialism is to be made a criminal offense  then we should equally criminalize other such thoughts including the comfort women denialism in Japan or that Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union was a pre-emptive strike.

CMV: Donald Trump's wall will lead to higher food prices and a more dangerous drug problem,"This is a topic I've though a lot about and I cannot get past this problem.  First  let me preface by saying I do believe a wall  if properly implemented  would indeed severely restrict illegal immigration and drugs into the U.S.  I say this with the benefit of some experience; I spent 6 months deployed on the U.S/New Mexico border an was able to see first hand how drugs and humans are smuggled.  I also spent a year deployed on the Egypt/Israeli border and was able to visit Israel several times; specifically Jerusalem.  I saw first hand how effective the wall around the West Bank is.  Yes  there will be tunnels.  But tunnels are very restrictive  expensive and time consuming.  With technology and time  they can be discovered easily.  They also create bottlenecks and are riskier than smuggling across the border on foot.  In Palestine  Egyptians routinely find and destroy tunnels going from Sinai into Gaza.  CBP would necessarily need to have teams searching and destroying tunnels if a wall were built.

With all that said  I have serious reservations about it because I believe an effective wall will lead to rising food costs  concentrated (and more dangerous) drugs  and possibly the almost total elimination of the farming  beef and poultry industries.  The U.S. is extremely dependent on illegal labor for farming  poultry  and beef.  If the wall is effective in keeping illegal immigrants out  the labor pool will slowly dwindle.  [Other states have tried banning illegal immigrant labor only to find that Americans were far less productive and demanded higher wages than illegal labor.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/alabama-tried-a-donald-trump-style-immigration-law-it-failed-in-a-big-way/2015/08/22/2ae239a6-48f2-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html?utm_term=.b5425ae046a2).  Even if Americans start working in farming again  the cost of food will jump due to their demands for higher wages.  This will only inflict more misery on the lower and middle classes.  If in the case Americans are simply unwillingly to do this hard labor  Mexico's produce industry will slowly gain market share and push out American farmers.  The drug problem: history has shown time and time again that people will find alternatives to banned/controlled things.  Fentanyl and synthetic marijuana are perfect examples.  Both are more dangerous than the drugs they intended to replace; if we are able to severely restrict illegal narcotics into the U.S.  people will turn to increasingly dangerous  more potent drugs with increasingly dangerous side effects.  It's important to note that most of these drugs come from China in the form of powders  though some does come from Mexico.  The U.S. is a nation of drug addicts; it will find its fix.

I am not diametrically opposed to a wall  but I do believe it will lead to more problems than we already have with regards to drugs and illegal immigration.  What haven't I thought about?  What viable solutions are there to these problems?  Am I way off base here?

"CMV: Police issuing PBA cards and other credentials to their friends, family, and donors is wrong","A [PBA card](http://imgur.com/tUMmzHw) is issued by police unions for officers to give to their friends or family members. The recipient can later present it when he interacts with another officerÑtypically when pulled over in his car  where the card may get him just a warning instead of a ticket. ItÕs not a get-out-of-jail-free card exactly  and it probably wonÕt do much if youÕre driving drunk or speeding at 90 in a school zone  but it does work. (Consider sources like [this one](http://www.nj.com/njvoices/index.ssf/2012/05/pba_cards_do_they_work_and_sho.html).) There are also devices like [these shields](http://imgur.com/Tpec51I) which  as I understand  are awarded to people who donate to the PBA.
 
My position is that distributing these credentials is shameless corruption by state officials in favor of their friends  family  and benefactors. If you know a cop or you give them money  you have a longer leash to break the law. Although a PBA card isnÕt going to let you get away with murder  escaping a speeding ticket is far more useful in the average personÕs life. And even if these cards excuse you from only minor violations  avoiding a $100+ ticket is a big deal for most people. (And whether $100 or $50 or $1  itÕs equally wrong in principle.)

Here are some of the counterarguments IÕve heard:

- **Professional courtesy**Ña cop accepting a motoristÕs PBA card is just looking out for his colleaguesÕ friends and family  like his colleagues do for him. An argument like this would be appropriate in a McDonaldÕsÑÒI gave my coworkerÕs wife a free hamburger  just like he did for my brother last week.Ó ItÕs not strictly *fair* that you get a free hamburger just because you know the cook  but who cares? But here  the benefit isnÕt a hamburger  itÕs the unequal enforcement of our public laws. Essays like [this one](http://njlawman.com/Feature%20Pieces/Professional%20Courtesy.htm) characterize professional courtesy as just a nice perk of belonging to the police brotherhood  but they either ignore or somehow miss the fact that  when youÕre a sworn officer of the law and you wear and gun and a badge  you really *shouldnÕt* get to favor your and your colleaguesÕ friends and family. ItÕs bizarre that I should even need to make such a statementÑit seems so obvious.

- **Moral support for cops**Ña person whoÕs displaying a suction-cup shield or police bumper sticker isnÕt trying to reap any special treatment from the police but rather is just showing his support for their service  especially in a day and age where thereÕs a lot of hostility against cops. Though I donÕt really buy this claim  IÕll grant for the sake of argument that some people do just want to show support and donÕt wish or expect a benefit. (But I also suspect that those same people wouldnÕt refuse some leniency if it were offered.) But thereÕs no such excuse for something like a PBA card  which you donÕt whip out until the officer is at your window with his ticket pad.

- **Sour grapes**ÑIÕm just jealous that I donÕt have a card. Over the last decade (and most recently  just a couple of weeks ago) IÕve been offered cards from a family friend who is a very senior law enforcement official in this area and whose name would be familiar to any state or local cop who pulled me overÑbut IÕve declined to take it. So  itÕs not just jealousy.

This practice seems so brazenly corrupt and nepotistic that I genuinely canÕt think of any legitimate reason to justify it  which is why IÕm hoping for some help from r/changemyview.",151,3,4,6,6,"[['racket](http://nypost.com/2010/01/10/friend-of-pba-cards-for-sale/)'], ['link](http://www.nj.com/njvoices/index.ssf/2012/05/pba_cards_do_they_work_and_sho.html)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart']]",0,36,1,Yes
CMV: Adolescents should never be protected from the truth; they should be taught everything including how to cope with harsh reality. I believe this is one of the biggest parenting errors our culture frequently makes,"The kid-safe version of reality adults use in the presence of young people locks kids into a bubble of misinformation that they have to spend a third of their lives climbing out of  with great dissonance. It's a polite pretense that the world is all sunshine and roses but it's actually maintained for the benefit adults  who want to see children as innocent because it's easier to cope with a charmingly befuddled kid than one who cusses and complains about the state of the world. 

I can think of no important truth that adolescents can't adapt to constructively if they are able to learn it. If you can name one  you can CMV. Please only address this main point in your replies  though. I'm also not talking about graphic depictions of war and suffering  just ideas about how things work.

Obviously I would not want anyone to go too far and fill young minds with an imbalanced amount of negativity  so assume a reasonable effort to raise a healthy-minded and fully cognisant adult.

EDIT: I have no problem with attuning the message to the developmental level of the listener. I just think it's terrible to *use ignorance as a parenting technique*. Rather than give an age range  I'll say that adolescence is when someone is learning to be adult and no longer fully content to be a child. My definition of successful coping in this context is when a person comes through an event with more good than harm  as a mainstream psychologist would see it.

CMV: post-op transgender people should always inform new partners before engaging in sexual activities,"I was just reading through [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/43398h/always_be_honest_and_upfront_about_who_you_are/)  and I was surprised to see that it's quite controversial to expect your sexual partner to be forthright with information that a sizable portion of the population will consider important; some people wrote that it shouldn't matter  and it's transphobic to no longer be interested upon hearing that the potential partner used to be the opposite sex.

I can (I think) envision the struggle that a post-op transgender might go through. Someone who so desperately wanted to be seen as the opposite sex that they went to extreme measures: months of hormone therapy  surgery  and recovery. Now they're finally happy in their own skin. It'd be miserable to dig up a past better left forgotten every time they become intimate with someone. I can absolutely empathize with this perspective  so I'm looking forward to your arguments. 

Here's my current view: It is unethical not to disclose to sexual partners that you are a post-op transgender. Even if it's your opinion that it shouldn't matter. Even if you think that you literally ARE  in every relevant sense  just who you appear to be. It's unethical because a lot of people have strong feelings when it comes to this matter  and it's likely that the person would have made a different decision (for a variety of reasons) if that information were available to them. **By withholding information  you essentially impose your beliefs on another without their knowledge  and make decisions for them.**

It's unfair to unleash a potential whirlwind of confusion and hurt on someone simply to ensure your own sexual gratification. Maybe that person only wants to become intimate with prospective lifelong partners  and they are hoping or expecting to naturally reproduce with said partner. Maybe someone just doesn't like the idea of having sex with a post-op transgender. Sure  you may think these reasons are fucking stupid and invalid  but that still doesn't give you the right to make decisions for anyone else. 

CMV.


EDIT: Well.. you've all given me some incredibly tough thoughts to chew over. I've read most of the comments even if I haven't replied. They've all been very useful. My view has changed in the direction of the opposition. I have a feeling this sort of discussion will be looked at in the future like how we currently see debates about gay marriage or some other progressive issue. I suspect the state of things will be incredibly ambiguous on these fronts in the future  especially as technology gets more powerful in its ability to transform our bodies  and accordingly people will be more open or at least cognizant of the possibility that they'll run into transpeople. For now though  I still think it's polite to inform people before bumping uglies.

"CMV: As an environmental engineer, I give up! PLEASE CMV!","Greetings

I am an environmental engineer  with a degree in environment and land management. I have studied and dedicated my professional life to make a change on our world  to make this planet a better place for future generations and protect it from those that would exploit it for greed and short term gain.

After 15 years of working in the field I am ready to give up. The fact is most people don't give a shit about our planet and the legacy we are leaving for future generations. I have worked hard  sometimes more than 70 hours a week  to see all that I have accomplished destroyed by short sighted corporations and the uncaring government that work for them.

I have been called a useless hippy who works only to stifle profits  I have seen the depths of which government and corporations will go to fuck us all for short term gains and I have lived for many years barely breaking even and financially keeping myself afloat because most environmental jobs that aren't about exploiting the system to maximize a companies profits pays for shit.

Well now I have a wife  a son  banks who are hounding me night and day to pay back my student loans and the dream of offering a better life for my family. This week I have been offered two new career opportunity. One is to manage a non profit organisation dedicated to protecting the last vestiges of forests and wetlands around the city i live in (while paying only 13$/h). The other is for a big construction company  to make sure that it is compliant with the pathetic environmental regulations while it bulldozes over the last natural ecosystems we have (but for more money per month than I ever made in a year)

I am to give my decision next week and I am truly considering for the first time in my life to give up my principals and go work for the money. I need somebody to change my views  but I am so tired of living poor  of not being respected and of seeing all my work be for nothing.

Edit: Wow I am getting finger cramps from replying to all of these great posts (very few of them were not so great ... you know who you are!) I sincerely thank you all for contributing to this great discussion. I have made this post as a whimsical experiment... I have already discussed about my career choice with my wife and close family and I have already come to a decision considering what to do with my immediate future. I just wanted to anonymously find out what the reddit community thought about my hard decision and I have been more than happily suprised with the response. This is the essence of what makes reddit so great... Many thanks to all of you... I will continue to respond to as many comments as I can and tomorrow I will update this post with my final decision and the reasons why I chose it.   

Final decision Edit: First I would like to thank you all for this awesome CMV. It went way beyond what I had ever expected and I don't think I have ever spent so much time typing since my time at university. Like I said in the previous edit  I had already reached a decision by consulting my wife  my friends and my family  but all the incredible advice and the insightful comment gave me great hope that my decision will be the right one for my career  myself and my family. So here it goes

I have decided to take the construction industry job for the following reasons:

- Right now it is an awful time to be working in the non-profit NGO  where I live. The conservative government has slashed all funding in the environment sector and the provincial government only cares about austerity. If I took the NGO job  I wouldn't even be guarantied to be able to keep it for very long if the meager funding dries out.

- I have been working in the same field  with the same people for over 15 years. I am feel enthusiastic about learning new things and working with new people. Also if I learn the inner workings of the construction industry  I may become much more efficient to enact long term meaningful changes.

- I have been living poor (well much more then most engineer do) for the past 15 and I still have some student loans to reimburse. Banks have constantly been picking at my heels and it will be quite a load of my stress  if I can finally repay then and make then STFU! Also having some form of financial stability would be great for a change.

- Although where I live  our society has quite the safety net and I am assured that my child will never lack of his basic needs whatever salary I make  It would be great to offer my family a better quality of life. Rest assured I am not someone who will have more money go to his head. By nature  I am not a great consumer and I am very likely to put most of my money aside for personal projects and even help out the NGO I had worked for and respect.

- I have dedicated my entire life to fight for the environment and that in not about to change  even if I work in a different field. Over the years I have found that enacting change from the outside of a system is next to impossible  so it will be quite interesting to see if change can be had from the inside. 

- My greatest fear is that the construction job asks me to compromise to much on my value and that makes me fall into a depression. In order to prevent this scenario  I will be following the advice given by many of you. Quickly put money aside  so I can safely bail out if thing get to rough and have multiple contingency plan if ever it does. 

- Finally I must admit that the money does sound attractive. I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family  I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness  it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me  but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life  I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me) 

Once again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls  their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place  feel free to go out an plant a tree. In the long run it does actually make a difference. Ardaron9 out!       

Tldr: CMV really worked and I no longer believe that going to work for a big construction company is a huge betrayal of my environmental values.

CMV: According to Trump's own estimates: Trump is Bad at Business,"**What I mean: **
*At the time of the election  we had all the information required to conclude that Donald Trump is most likely below average at making money. At least according to his own reports - but also according to others estimates of it. *

For some reason  even Trump critics just let this narrative go unchallenged. Am I missing something  or is this just good marketing at work? 

Many people supported him as a business man that might bring good negotiating and business sense to the presidency. **What evidence do we have that he actually has these skills?** Is he just conning us on this  or should I change my view?  

It was hard not to turn serious wealth into absurd wealth in the 80s and 90s given the growth of the markets - yet Trump somehow **lost** inflation adjusted money against pure beta market strategies while getting bailed out through multiple bankruptcies. 

**Definitions:**
When I say: 

- bad - I mean worse than the average American investor. You might compare this to the market average  or your retirement fund. 
- business - I mean making money. You could argue that businesses build social value too but I would imagine that this would only aggravate the issue. 
- is - I mean the relevant  representative portion of his public record - I care more about him at 70 than at 60  60 than 50  50 than 40 and so on. He ran for president at 70  so what did the country vote for? Let me know if you think this isn't reasonable. 

**Evidence**
We only know so much about Donald Trump's wealth. This is by design. There is a largely uncontested record that he avoids exposing his net worth. However  there are a few points in his career where we have some insight: 

In 1982  Forbes estimated Donald Trump's wealth was worth $200M. Trump claimed it was closer to $500M. Pick either source.

- https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ghmf45edldg/1982-the-forbes-400/
We don't know how he got this money. Given that his father Fred Trump was still around  is possible this money was the result of going into the family business  good advice from his father  straight up gifted money  or our business savvy. Maybe he earned it all in a mere 15 years. Maybe most of the value came from his father's company. Either way  it hardly seems relevant to his expected performance today. It seems intellectually dishonest to just ignore the fact that his father was so good at making money in the same industry  so let's compare this period to the period where his father was not in business. 

In 2016 Trump claimed his net worth was $5B  then later that it was $10B. Forbes put it at closer to $4.1B. We know he likes to inflate this number but again  pick your source.

Compare 1982-2016 performance: Trump vs. The average investor. 

Now we have enough info to compare the two. According to Trump  Trump turned each 1982 dollar into at most  $20. This pretty much lines up with the Forbes math too. 

An index fund represents how much growth is due simply to beta - market growth - not the investor. It represents how an average investor would perform over the same period with the same assets. The average person with a pension could also be considered an investor of sorts into their own retirement. 

Given the performance of a typical retirement fund over this same period  or a simple index fund (like the S&P 500) over this same period  an average performer would have turned each dollar into $40. Given Trump's starting point  he should be worth $20B. A far cry from even his most ostentatious claim.

According to Trump  he has **lost** approximately $10B through his business enterprises compared to the average investor. Not to mention that he worked hard throughout this entire period (as opposed to a passive fund strategy). And that he had to file for bankruptcy for his busniesses four times - leaving those who trusted him with their money in the lurch.

*How can we consider him ""good"" at business when the best info **he gives us** seems to indicate that he has performed **far below average** for the last 30+ years? CMV*

Updated bankruptcy section to specifically reflect that these are corporate bankruptcies**

"CMV: In presidential debates, candidates should be held responsible for objectively untrue statements in some capacity","Recently  there has been some debate about what role the moderators should take in a presidential debate. Some argue that the moderator should be more avidly fact-checking the debates  while others argue that such a proposition would be overrun with bias.

However  there were a few moments where candidates made statements that are objectively incorrect. It's true  matters of hypothetical policy cannot be objectively measured. However  matters of public record can be. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlI5l41Hpww) is Donald Trump incorrectly claiming that he has not called global warming a Chinese hoax. [Here's a long list of tweets (plus one video!) where he does](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/54o7o1/donald_trump_absolutely_did_say_global_warming_is/d83lqqb?context=3) very clearly call global warming a hoax. And for the sake of fairness  Hillary Clinton [absolutely did call the TPP the ""gold standard ""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q124hZLKpeQ) no ""hope it would be"" anywhere to be found.

Most of these are big talking points  and a candidate has to know that these topics would be brought up. Both Trump saying Clinton called TPP the ""gold standard"" and Clinton saying Trump called global warming a ""Chinese hoax"" are *objectively true statements.* They are on the record. And there needs to be a protocol for that objective evidence to be presented to the public. In both events  the candidate against which the claims were made interrupted with a form of protest. Trump claimed he never said that  while Clinton tried to twist the context into a ""hope it will"" situation  even though that is not how it was delivered. Particularly in a debate like this one  that means no minds will be changed. There is no debate of facts  it's simply he said  she said. Trump supporters will believe Trump is unfairly being attacked  even when it is undeniable fact that he said those things about climate change. Clinton supporters will argue her words were taken out of context  when in-context they don't sound much better. 

I don't propose the moderator himself take the role of fact-checker  but both camps should be able to present an indisputable piece of evidence to support them. Instead  they should simply admit or reject evidence presented by the campaigns.

It's not a perfect solution  and it will change the format of the debates to some extent. However  there are cases where there is objectively correct  and objectively incorrect. Many situations in the debate do not fall into those two categories. However  it's mind-boggling to think that one candidate can say ""I never said that "" the other can say ""yes you did "" and the moderator can say ""let's agree to disagree"" and move on to another question. When there is an objective truth  there should be a non-partisan system in place to make it clear to the audience who is in the right  and who is in the wrong.

CMV: The Left in the US has made a better effort to understand the Right than the Right has to understand the Left.,"We have seen some pieces in the liberal media trying to understand conservative voters. They haven't necessarily been particularly good  nor has broader effort to understand the right been particularly good on the left's part. However  something is better than nothing  and in at least a few cases these writings have come from a place of empathy. And that's what the Right hasn't done at all  in my view: present an effort to understand voters on the opposing side through a lens of empathy.

So C my V: show me a sincere  empathetic look at left-wing voters coming from a reasonably well-known right-wing individual or institution trying to understand voters on the left and why they think the way they do. (edited for clarity  thanks /u/Generic_On_Reddit)

"CMV: on the whole, the Republican Party is far more willing than the Democratic Party to deny or disregard science-based evidence in policy-making.","There are multiple core Republican ideologies and policies that are directly contradicted by scientific consensus. While not every republican voter or politician endorses all of these points  they are all common in the republican mainstream and each of these is endorsed by Donald Trump  Mike Pence  and/or Paul Ryan:

- Denial of global warming  which is virtually uncontested among climatologists. 

- Belief in creationism  which no serious biologists endorse. 

- Opposition to gay rights on the grounds that gay marriage and adoption is bad for children  despite multiple authoritative studies to the contrary. 

- Support for North Carolina's HB2 and similar anti-transgender laws on the basis of protecting women  despite the paucity of actual cases of assault in bathrooms by transgender people. 

- Belief that vaccines cause autism  a position so discredited that the journal that originally published it rescinded the article. 

- Belief that Barack Obama was born in Kenya  despite the total lack of concrete evidence and presence of documents to the contrary. 

Meanwhile  among democrats  I cannot think of any major policy or ideology points that are directly contradicted by science. Some  such as the actual magnitude of the gender wage gap or the efficacy of gun control  are open questions that democrats tend to talk about with more certainty than is warranted  but in neither of those cases is the scientific community as United as on  say  global warming or vaccines.

"In the event of a government shutdown, I think that Congress should be part of the personnel that does not get paid. CMV.","First of all  I will link this [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/09/25/225453255/your-government-shutdown-questions-answered) about Congress getting paid just in case you don't believe me. About mid-way through the article  the question of Congressional pay is answered.

* First claim: I believe that it is beyond ridiculous for the same people that can cause the shutdown to still get paid while it is in effect. 

How is it that the very entity that can cause [800K - 1M (estimate from WaPo)](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/agencies-prepare-to-furlough-workers-in-face-of-partial-government-shutdown/2013/09/26/d1b7b336-26db-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_story.html) federal employees to go without pay still be allowed to received their share? Am I the only one that thinks that is ludicrous? I get it: the Republicans don't want to fund the ACA  but how the hell can one justify furloughs of federal employees to make their point. I *might* (by an extremely long shot) understand if by chance all of the employees to be furloughed were staunch supporters of the ACA  but that is undoubtedly be the case (speculation w/o link.)

* Second claim: I think that there should be a fail-safe to counter a stalemate in Congress that would lead to a shutdown.

My knee-jerk reaction says that there should be an emergency ballot for the voter-eligible public to vote on the measures that Congress cannot decide  but I feel that this would bite America in the ass. The last thing we need is the party-allegiant to vote on something that one side wants and the other doesn't. So I think that perhaps the [874 federal judges](http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/FederalJudgeships.aspx) should have a say so in the matter. I honestly do not know how good of an idea this is. I went with federal judges  because at least they're in the know about law. I understand that interpretation of the law does not translate to federal budgeting matters  but I think it is something.

* Third claim: While a fail-safe would be nice  I think that the statute regarding a shutdown should be revised.

I understand the incentive behind a shutdown (so I think): no Congress wants to be known as the Congress that caused the shutdown  but I don't think it works as intended. There have been 17 shutdowns since 1976 which works out to be almost one shutdown every other year. I will concede that about [more than half have lasted for less than a week](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/25/here-is-every-previous-government-shutdown-why-they-happened-and-how-they-ended/)  yet I still think that 17 out of a possible 37 is inexcusable. 

I wish that I could elaborate more. I honestly do not have an answer for a proper revision in case of a stalemate. The best I can give is that there should be enough incentive to make Congress set aside their differences while allowing federal employees to continue receiving pay for work.

* Fourth claim: I think that the actions of Congress are ultimately ~~childish~~ pitiful.

I do not believe that there is much to say about this claim. The youngest member of the Senate and House is [currently 40 and 30](http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp) respectively. [This is the Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_youngest_members_of_the_United_States_Congress#List_of_youngest_members_of_the_United_States_Senate) is the  to alleviate an exhaustive search of the first source. To be 30+ and unable to come to a consensus about major life-altering events is laughable. That is really all I have to say about that.

**Note**: I will add that my view may be a little tainted. I depend on VA disability and VA educational benefits to pay my bills. I also work for the VA under federal work-study  so as it currently stands  my paycheck under a shutdown on Nov 1 would be exactly $0.00 (per my research at about noon on 30 Sep.) I also apologize if this is somewhat incoherent; it is whiskey Mondays at the AmateurHero abode.

Edit: FWIW  I think that Congress should still be forced to meet until a deal upon which has been settled. (Preposition make for funny sentence structures.) Once they've come to a consensus  they can resume payment.

Edit 2.0: Thanks for all of the responses. When I woke up this morning and thought about this post  I realized that denying payment likely would not be effective. I admit that my method for fixing the situation is wrong  but I do think that *something* should happen to those that are responsible. I know that there are worse things in the world than a furlough for 800K - 1M federal employees. Regardless  I still firmly believe that using furloughs as a bargaining chip is tasteless. All-in-all  I still believe that the law needs to the changed to prevent those who are marginally effected from holding all of the power.",204,3,7,9,11,"[['loaf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nutraloaf)'], ['http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/net_worth_of_united_states_senators_and_representatives#top_and_bottom', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/averages.php', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salaries_of_members_of_the_united_states_congress'], [""http://www.senate.gov/crsreports/crs-publish.cfm?pid='*2%404p%5c%5b%3a%22%40%20%20%0a""], ['salaries](http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/governmentjobs/a/annual-salaries-of-top-us-government-officials.htm)'], ['supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loss_of_supply)'], ['rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hastert_rule),'], ['http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6233470.stm'], ['wreck"".](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/05/10/affordable-care-act-obamacare-column/2144409/)'], ['http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/11/money-wins-white-house-and.html']]",1,63,1,Yes
"CMV: I think Economics is largely a backwards field rooted in pseudoscience, unscrutinized cultural biases, and political manipulation.","Before I begin - I want to clarify that I do not believe the fundamental intent of the field of Economics is invalid.  There is definitely a utility to exploring how goods and services are distributed across a society and many fields have benefited from certain basic concepts developed in Economics.

But on the whole  I generally think Economists are full of it.  Now I am by no means an expert in the field and this perception may just be the result of my own ignorance  I got my degree in Physics.  But it seems to me that the field is defined by political agendas (whether they be extolling the inherent benevolence of Free-Market Capitalism or pushing for greater involvement in the economy) rather than the objective and open-ended pursuit of knowledge as found in the sciences and to a lesser extent the social sciences.  Economists seem hopelessly rooted in the worship of figures like Smith  Ricardo  Keynes  and Marx  stubbornly committed to reworking their theories into something that sort of fits the economic realities they can't ignore and jives with the political principles they like.  While most Social Sciences seem to have an issue political agendas  Economics looks completely and fundamentally broken in its lack of rigor. Even in fields like History or Anthropology where there is considerable politicizing  there is a broad consensus on the fundamentals of methodology and the legitimacy of certain ideas that keeps everyone on the right track.  Meanwhile  you have Economists like Paul Krugman and Steve Keen not just forwarding their respective political platforms  but disagreeing about the **fundamental operation of economies.**  I haven't seen anything like this in any of the other social sciences.  I haven't seen Sociologists debate whether or not social stratification even exists  Linguists reject the idea that cultural pressures can change languages  or Archaeologists fight over whether or not settlement patterns can tell us about cultural evolution.  When I read about each of these fields  I see a clear progression in their work: a refinement of methods  a building of knowledge  the revision of basic assumptions to fit new data.

Then I read pieces by influential Economists that [basically confess the cluelessness of people working in the field](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?_r=0) on the one hand and on the other hand assert that their theories [don't require empirical validation](http://mises.org/epofe/c1p2sec2.asp) and I can't help but think ""Wow  the emperor has no clothes."" While Economists (hilariously) try to create an air of credibility to their work by expressing their theories with mathematical formulas  the doesn't change the fact that the basic ideas that underpin the field are based not on empirical data but rather the assumptions they've made about the world and humanity.  ( [A Mathematician put out a critique about Economists' use of mathematics a few years back that I really enjoyed.](http://ineteconomics.org/blog/inet/economics-not-math) )  It continues to be rooted in empirically invalidated and scientifically outdated ideas like humans being fundamentally individualistic and rational simply because that is the way Western society currently likes to understand itself.  The fact that this has gone largely unchallenged in the field and that many of the field's seminal concepts were derived from the [haphazard reworking of Newtonian equations](http://books.google.com/books?id=xA4Y3lkcpscC&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=david+ricardo+newtonian+equations&source=bl&ots=JrCF7Cot_s&sig=tCpgQ31mlctVtDToQ2A6GUsWYa0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7lMdVKSTJ4WGyASx2YIQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=david%20ricardo%20newtonian%20equations&f=false) says that both in terms of its internal discourse and topical theorization  Economics is very shallow and just about keeping the illusion of knowing what you are talking about.  Psychologists have embraced Neuroscience  Historians have begun to employ Computer Science  Biology has come to play a fundamental role in Anthropology  and Geography is constantly reworking itself to incorporate the work done in the hard sciences.... but Economists seem intent on ignoring the work of other fields and pretending they have all the answers.

**EDIT: Folks  please stop reminding me that Economics is not a hard science.  I am aware that the Social Sciences have to deal with issues that aren't as easily empirically explored as those in the hard sciences.  If you read my post closely  you will see that I am arguing (among other things) that Economics is lousy because it is even less empirical than other Social Sciences  which are legitimate and valid.** 

Economics has limited predictive power and every time Economists claim to be able to explain something  some new economic catastrophe occurs and they're all left scratching their heads  trying to figure out why their explanations don't conform to reality.  But the worst part? The worst part is the fact that of all the social sciences  Economics has the most sway in our society.  It isn't supported and respected as a field because it tells or explains economies very well but rather because it feeds into whatever businesspeople and politicians alike want to hear.

CMV: US public school teachers are typically underpaid and should receive more compensation,"Over time  IÕve noticed a recurrence in the grievances of teachers (and professors) whom IÕve had the pleasure of speaking to one-on-one: they do not feel properly compensated (monetarily) for the amount of work they put into their job. I often find myself agreeing with this.

Teachers play an important role in our society. They shape the minds of our youth. Cliche as that may seem  it is also very much true. The platform they possess can be used to effect some real change in the education of their students  so why are their salaries regarded so lowly in some districts? I believe the equity theory (employees like to get what they deserve) holds in this case. I donÕt believe  however  that their motivation for doing their job is always monetary-based. As mentioned before  they play an important role  and the acknowledgment of such is all some teachers want. This does not change the fact that I see them as having an underpaid occupation  and that is the point IÕm looking to convey here.

But thatÕs just my take in this situation. IÕd love to know what my fellow redditors think. LetÕs see if someone can really change my view on this!

EDIT: Thank you for all of the responses  everyone! Many of you have mentioned the other complexities to the situation  and they are real eye-openers.

CMV: Hillary Clinton is unfit for presidency.,"I believe that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is corrupt  a liar  and a hypocrite.

1. Hillary Clinton is corrupt. She or her husband routinely [have taken money from companies](http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/oops-bill-clinton-says-he-accidentally-took-500000-from-algeria-during-key-arms-negotiation-with-state-department)  that they then go on to give government contracts. [One of her largest donors was given a spot on the nuclear advisory board  with no experience at all.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/clinton-had-donor-as-nuclear-security-adviser.html) She will not release her speech transcripts  which hints at the fact that Hillary may have told them something that she doesn't want to get out. Whether it be corruption or something else; she is hiding something.



2. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite and a liar. She takes huge sums of cash from wall street  and then says that she is going to breakup the banks. She says that she is a women's rights activist  and yet takes millions from countries like Saudi Arabia. I haven't even mentioned Hillary's flip flopping on all sorts of her campaign issues  and described in [this](http://imgur.com/Ls3B6n1) image. You can see her whole platform change in response to Bernie Sanders. She seems to say anything to get elected.

Based on all this  how can people support her? The facts are right there  and yet Hillary continues to get many votes. Is there something that I'm missing? It seems as if the second she gets in office she will support the big donors that she has pledged against. Throughout this whole thing  I haven't yet talked about Hillary's email scandal. She held secret government files on a server that was *hacked multiple times.* If someone could show me the reasons to support Hillary that would be great.

CMV: I feel like the Republicans are the 'bad guys' PLEASE CMV!,"I've drunk the koolaide. I'm becoming a biased partisan hack. I believe that one of the biggest problems with this country is the deep  seemingly irreconcilable animosity between the followers of the two parties  and I am part of that problem. 



Yet as much as I try  I cannot bring myself to view the Republicans as anything but a regressive influence on the USA. On some deep level  I've accepted the stereotype that Republican voters are bible thumping  gun wielding  blindly patriotic semi-racists. I'm not talking so much about the elected officials but rather the voters. I feel that  from what I can gather through the 'liberal' media and my personal experience  Republican opinions are largely formed (at least more so than Democrats) on ignorance  xenophobia  religion  guns  and hatred for Obama. I know such a broad and negative stereotype can't really be true  but I still can't shake it. I don't pretend to understand much about economics so most of my feelings come from my revulsion with the party's stance on social issues. 



Here are a few bits of my limited understanding of the party's platform:



Social Issues: 

- Opposing gay marriage: I have tried to find a credible argument against gay marriage  but have repeatedly failed. Currently  their argument before the supreme court rests on gays being unfit to raise children/procreate and the floodgates opening for polygamy etc.  

- Downplaying racial/gender discrimination as out of control political correctness: This seems like mostly suburban/rural white men being unable to empathize with groups of people they've never/rarely met. And some genuine racism.

- Defensiveness over religion/guns: The gun debate is too muddied for me to have a strong opinion on  but I feel Republicans' fears over attacks on Christianity are largely unfounded and that  if anything  Christianity has too large an influence on our culture/government.

- Immigration: I don't understand the positives/negatives of different approaches to immigration  but the Republican voter's opposition seems to come from xenophobia and trumped up fear about terrorists/freeloaders sneaking in.



Security Issues:

- Support for aggressive policing and invasive homeland security: I realize Rand and Co have been at the forefront of action against the NSA  but my personal experience has left me believing that most Republican voters are for strengthening national security and increasing military spending. I also feel that the strongest voices to come out in support of the recent police-on-black violence were conservatives.

- Hawkish foreign policy: I feel that Republicans have an emotional and aggressive reaction to Russia  Iran  Syria  ISIS and would be more willing to intervene militarily without regard to whether or not such intervention would be beneficial. They seem willing to pursue cathartic violence and disinclined to examined our militaries checkered past.



Economic Issues:

- Welfare Queens: Again  I really don't understand enough about economics to judge a good policy from a bad one  but I see the Republicans as using the idea of welfare queens to scare up opposition to social programs and further stigmatize the poor. They view Obamacare/Goverment assistance as handouts given to the undeserving.

- Blame the poor: It feels like Republicans push the idea that  without regulations  people will be able to pull themselves out of poverty and that the only thing keeping them down is either the government or their own laziness.



Environmental Issues:

- Global warming skepticism: This seems motivated by the party's ties to fossil fuel  fear of change  hatred for anything Obama  and anti-intellectual disdain for 'nancy-pansy' green stuff.





TL:DR - I feel like the Republican voting base is motivated primarily by religion  xenophobia  fear of change  hatred for Obama. Their positions are ignorant  contradict available evidence  short sighted  and selfish. 





What would change my mind?

-Evidence of a largely liberal leaning media/culture that suppresses honest Republican voices and prevents me from seeing the other side of the picture.

-Evidence that Republican news media (Fox  Breibart  Drudge  Talk Radio  etc) are reputable and not fear mongering propaganda barkers. 

-Strong arguments supporting the Republican platform and evidence that Republican voters share these views.

-Surprise me!



THANK YOU and please please please help me shed this ugly bias!!!

CMV: Safe space and victim culture is going to create a generation of losers,"Before I make my points  I would like to acknowledge a couple of things. First of all  I recognise that certain people from certain demographics sometimes do need a helping hand. This is not what i have an issue with. I am a big believer in equity. 

I also recognise that as a white male in the Western world I have it relatively easy  I will admit that.

That being said...


I firmly believe that the culture of safe spaces and ""being a victim"" online and increasingly on many university/college campuses throughout Europe and the US Is going to create a generation of graduates and young people that are simply not prepared for the realities and challenges of wider society. A rather recent case that prompted me to start considering this was an incident concerning a student named Imogen Wilson at Edinburgh University (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/03/student-accused-of-violating-university-safe-space-by-raising-he/)

The tl;dr of this situation is that Wilson was threatened with ejection from a meeting for raising her hand to disagree with a point being made  a gesture that is apparently a violation of university safe space rules which state that students should  Òrefrain from hand gestures which denote disagreementÓ  or Òin any other way indicate disagreement with a point or points being madeÓ.

I believe that speaks for itself.

In the real world  people who disagree with a point you are making will probably do more than raise their hand. They might get annoyed. They might call you an idiot. There's probably not going to a be a safe space when you're employed. How is any of this preparing college kids for life outside of campus? How is this preparing them for the workplace or to go into business? What happens if their business pitch is shot down or if they have to work alongside someone whose views don't align with their own? Are they going to fold at the first hurdle?

Universities should be a bastion of discussion and free thought. If we start eroding that because some people cannot or will not accept/acknowledge the differing views of others  that completely undermines the point of academia. If that's something you have a problem with  higher education probably isn't for you anyway.

EDIT: I don't know if my view has been changed  but I do feel that I have learned a lot and I have a much more moderate view of the subject.

"CMV: If a business has two individual bathrooms, both should be unisex bathrooms","The bathrooms I'm describing are the ones where there's a single door and a small room with a toilet  sink  and trashcan that are used by one person at a time. I don't think there's any reason to divide them by gender. By equipment  they're identical I believe it's pretty uncommon for them to have urinals. Frequently the women's restroom will have a short line I have to wait in  while the men's stall is completely unoccupied. Occasionally I'll jump the line and use the men's restroom anyway  but people will give you strange looks. I've had men point out that they could not so easily do the same thing if there were a line at the men's room  and I think that's a really good point. If a business wants to provide a baby changing table  they could simply install one and mark it on the door avoiding the issue of either paying for two or only installing one in the women's room and leaving dads with infants out of luck. It's also beneficial to trans individuals who may feel uncomfortable using a gendered restroom.

I really can't think of any reason why this isn't more frequently seen. CMV!

Edit: Two counterpoints in response to common arguments:

1. From a management bathroom cleaning point of view  a unisex bathroom could be an advantage. Let's say a women's bathroom dirties by 10 dirt units every hour  the men's restroom by 8 dirt units every hour  and the restrooms are cleaned every 4 hours. That means you're more likely to get a customer complaint and have an employee need to go clean the women's room in hour 3  wasting some time. If you have unisex bathrooms it would even out and they each dirty at 9 units per hour  so it's easier to keep them both equally clean.

2. It doesn't make good business sense to have anyone tied up in a line. If there are 3 women waiting to pee and the men's stall is free  I don't want those women waiting around I want them browsing my store  paying the bill and freeing up a table  getting to their movie  etc. This argument also only favors men.

CMV: The media should be prevented from releasing personal details of defendants in court cases until they are found guilty.,"In my country (UK)  the media is prevented from releasing the details of defendants in court cases if they are still a child  but as far as I'm aware anyone else (as long as its an open court) can have their name published and associated with the crimes they've been accused of before they have been found guilty.

I think this is wrong - in the eyes of the law  everyone is innocent until proven guilty  but many elements of the media and the public at large will assume there is 'no smoke without fire' and will always attach an element of doubt to a person's character if they know that person was accused of a crime  even if they were found not guilty.

The most famous examples of this happening are when people are falsely accused of rape. The accusers (quite rightly) have their anonymity protected but the accused do not  and in the cases where the accusations were false  the accused person's reputation is permanently damaged and their life may be ruined for many years to come. Rape charges are just one example  but I feel that this logic can be equally applied to any other charge.

The fix seems simple - prevent the media from publishing the name/age/description/etc of the defendants in all court cases  until after a guilty verdict has been rendered. Of course  if it's an open court then people are free to go there and find out who is being accused themselves (I understand the need for openness and transparency in a court of law wherever possible)  but what I'm talking about here is preventing the mass naming-and-shaming of people who are still (in the eyes of the law) innocent. This way  if a person is not found guilty of a crime then they have a better chance of returning to a normal life afterwards.

So what am I missing here? What is a good reason for keeping the status quo?

"Suicides should not be included in ""Gun Violence"" statistics, CMV","In the gun debate in this country there is one thing that constantly keeps popping up  and it drives me nuts.  Suicide deaths being counted in gun fatality statistics.  

>FirearmÑIn 2010  31 672 persons died from firearm injuries in
the United States (Tables 18 and 19)  accounting for 17.5% of all injury deaths in that year. The two major component causes of all firearm injury deaths in 2010 were suicide (61.2%) and homicide (35.0%).

[Source: CDC.gov page 11](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf)
In any debate  it's important to have your facts in order  and to be clear about what you're representing.  I believe that when politicians include suicides in their 'violent crime' numbers they are misrepresenting the actual problem and conflating gun violence with mental health problems.

[The definition of ""Violent Crime""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime) as per Wikipedia is as follows:

>A violent crime or crime of violence is a crime in which the offender uses or threatens to use violent force upon the victim. This entails both crimes in which the violent act is the objective  such as murder  as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end  (including criminal ends) such as robbery. Violent crimes include crimes committed with weapons. With the exception of rape (which accounts for 6% of all reported violent crimes)  males are the primary victims of all forms of violent crime.[1] A violent crime may end with injury or death  both on the part of victim and offender.

And below that: 

>The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report (FBI UCR) counts four categories of crime as violent crimes: murder and non-negligent manslaughter  forcible rape  robbery  and aggravated assault.[15] 

Suicide prevention is an important issue  and I think it needs to be discussed more in general  but by lumping it in to the gun deaths issue all that happens is you misrepresent one argument while failing to give the other the **REAL** attention it needs.

I'm open to having my view changed  but I need a good reason.


[edit] I would like to clarify  I feel that when people use the numbers of gun fatalities (including suicides) to defend the regulations they want to see happen they are being intellectually dishonest  as the regulations that they are recommending are tailored to attempt to reduce violent crime  not gun suicides.

"I believe that organ donation should be opt-out, not opt-in. CMV.","Opt-out would mean that instead of the organ shortages we currently face  we would have vastly more organs available for those who need them. Why? Because the vast majority of people do not care about signing a piece of paper that does not have and will not have any impact on their life. These same people would like their organs to be given to someone who needs them in the event of their death  but because of the fact that most people do not sign the form indicating that this is the case the people who would have donated cannot  and cannot for obvious reasons opt-in after the fact.

CMV: it doesn't matter when somone loses their virginity. The concept of virginity hurts almost everyone.,"Young or old. Loss of virginity has little impact on who someone is. Being a virgin does not mean someone is less likable or less socially adept.

The focus on virginity makes everyone either lose it for bad reasons or be really nervous the first time.

Speaking from personal experience  I had a terrible girlfriend pretty much just because I wanted not to be a virgin anymore.

We don't have specific words for people who haven't driven cars yet. I wouldn't assume someone who does not drive does not have the ability to do so. I understand why this concept makes some amount of sense. In a time without birth control a non virgin has essentially taken on the potential role of parenthood. It now only hurts people.

Edit: awarded a delta over a small intricacy of me saying people shouldn't judge virgins. I just think society is too focused on it as a whole. People can judge who ever they want.

CMV: Professional sports should not receive public funds.,"First of all  I think sports are  in general  highly beneficial for societies as a whole  the main reason being that they contribute to maintaining physical and mental health. Therefore  I believe that public spending in sport facilities for the community  whether they are gyms or skateparks  is crucial.

This does not hold for *professional sports*. Their main benefits are personal glory and growth for the sportsman himself. I donÕt think everyoneÕs ÒrecreationalÓ activity should be publicly funded. To be perfectly clear: I donÕt hate pro sports; they just donÕt seem useful to me.

I do think itÕs important to finance other activities that may be considered useless  such as art  music and pure math. These activities produce cultural growth  which I believe to be the ultimate goal of every society (once more immediate problems like lack of food or shelter are taken care of). I fail to see how pro sports produce cultural growth.

I do not think the average sportsman is a role model  in the same way I do not think the average musician or artist is a role model. Some sportsmen may be exceptional people in other aspects as well  but thatÕs purely coincidental.

Furthermore  from an utilitarian point of view  I understand that pro sports bring joy to millions  but the sports that fall into this category are exactly those that donÕt require public funding: they are already big enough to finance themselves  privately.

P.S.: IÕd really like my view to change about this particular subject.

"CMV: Just as a teacher gets a heavier-than-usual punishment for breaking public trust and sexually abusing a child, so elected officials should receive heavier-than-usual punishments for corruption.","I am a teacher. As someone who not only works with children but also has a huge influence over their actions and worldview  I am put in a place of huge trust by my employer: the public. I am forbidden  as a result  from proselytizing for any religious views or political ends  because it is an abuse of this power and the public's trust. As you can imagine  physical  emotional  or sexual abuse is even more serious when committed by a teacher (or coach  or clergyperson  or daycamp leader) than an ordinary citizen because of this power and public trust. I would lose my job promptly (rightly so!) and it is not easy to fire teachers here. I would obviously acquire a criminal record and I expect that the abuse of power might even mean harsher treatment from the law.

I don't disagree with any of this. Harsher consequences seem warranted here  as my ability to seriously hurt the children in my care is increased. I am expected to protect these children *from* harm  and so if I abuse them instead  I feel that breach of trust warrants a harsher punishment and the loss of my position.

I feel that elected officials are also **public positions** and theoretically  they are beholden to the electorate. They have been elected on the presumption that they would do their jobs well  and obviously  legally. Just as I  as a teacher  am trusted with children's welfare  so too are elected officials trusted with the law and legislature.

I believe that breaches of this trust  whether through bribery  electoral fraud  corruption  or otherwise  should be punished more harshly because of the position they hold: a position of increased responsibility and trust in lawmaking. Their job affects people's lives profoundly  and foul play should not be tolerated in the least.

Just as foul play with children in my position would lose me my job (forever)  give me a criminal record  and earn me a hefty punishment on top of that  I think foul play in legislature should also result in the loss of the position and a heavier-than-usual punishment. CMV

Edit: I would like to add some specificity here regarding what sort of punishment I mean  but being no expert of the law  I don't rightly know what sort of metric could be used to judge corruption's long-term detrimental effects on the public interest.

CMV: False Accusers Should Be Punished As If They Did the Crime,"While people making false accusations occur less often than some subreddits claim  they absolutely occur. But when it comes to light that the accusations of murder  assault  or rape were falsified  the false accusor (referred to as ""The Liar"") often is not charged or receives a much shorter sentence than the person they accused. 

And to be clear  I'm not referring to people who accuse someone of a crime and the alleged perpetrator isn't convicted. Nor am I referring to someone being mistaken. I am only talking about someone lying and fabricating evidence to get someone in trouble for a crime they didn't commit. 

This feels very wrong to me. The Liar attempted to get an innocent person in trouble  potentially costing them years of their life and staining the innocent persons reputation. The Liar should receive  at a minimum  the same level of punishment that would have been given to the person they lied about. It seems only fair  and would serve to put a greater deterrent to false accusations than what is currently in place. 

Tl:Dr  if you purposefully lie about someone doing a crime  you should be punished just as much as someone who did the crime you lied about.

CMV: Genderfluidity isn't a thing and is usually related to attention seeking/ being psychologically unstable or just being undecisive trans,"I have never seen any proof or scientific article about gender change being possible *on the go* from biological point of view.
In my opinion  these people who claim to be genderfluids are either undecisive about being trans people  which makes them go back to their original sex/gender from time to time. Or they are people mostly in their puberty age (that's the biggest part of genderqueers I've seen)  which have need to somehow express themselves  since possibly they have or had issues with attention lack from their family or friends and being *that special snowflake* really helps them get over it  I've also seen some g'fluids outgrow this period in their lifes and just becoming trans/ bisexual or even cis/straight.

I have also seen pretty quiet and introvert people being g'fluids. Those are examples which I can not link to seeking attention  just because they do not like it and like to be quiet about being unstable with choice of their gender. Those are the people I relate to being psychologically unstable/ depressive and maybe even it has something to do with self-hatred and just trying to find what they really seek from life.


Basically  my main points why genderfluidity isn't real:

* I have never seen any trustworthy study which proves it being biologically possible 

* it can be related to other problems in life and is just being form of self-expression 

* it may be related to psychological problems like depression or even self-hatred.


Since I am already banned on r/genderfluid for making same kind of discussion  I really hope to find better discussion with you all.

I believe that all single-user bathrooms should be unisex. CMV.,"To clarify  I'm talking about public bathrooms meant to be used by one person at a time. These bathrooms generally have deadbolt locks on the doors  have a toilet but no urinal  and (with the exception of maybe specialized waste receptacles) don't have anything that you wouldn't find in both types of bathroom. Given this  I don't see a reason why you would label that sort of bathroom specifically for men or women.

If the goal of segregating these bathrooms is to keep differently gendered people from seeing each other  it's single user  so that's not an issue. If it's to offer specialized equipment  most of the single user bathrooms I've encountered (for both sexes) don't do this anyway.

Edit: Wow  there is  um  a lot of stuff here! In case anyone is interested in whether my view has actually be changed  so far it has not. The three most common comments I've seen by far are:

1) ""[GENDER X] is dirtier and I don't want to deal with that.""

Let's presume that one gender is dirtier in general than another. Does that mean that we should essentially quarantine that gender into their own space? The implication there is that  as a member of a gender  am somehow responsible for messes that I didn't make and should be subjected to them based on that? Doesn't seem right to me. Also  in cases where you have 2 unisex restrooms  everyone will be able to hop over in the event that one is just *completely* trashed.

2) ""[GENDER X] takes too long in the restroom  I don't want to wait.""

There's some great math on this further down the thread  but the consensus is: while have two unisex restrooms and one line might make *your* wait a little longer  depending on your gender  it's going to make the *average* wait time lower overall. Sounds like a good tradeoff to me.

3 ""I treat restrooms like this anyway!""

Great! However  not everyone does  and more important  not everyone has the expectation that others do. Without everyone being on the same page  we lose a lot of the benefits of unisex restrooms  so I think changing the labeling is relevant even if  say  40% of people already treat restrooms this way.

CMV: Trump's call for Russia to find Clinton's deleted emails is treasonous.,"Put simply  he is requesting that our national security be compromised for his own political gain. 

Here's my logic... 

A) Trump believes that Clinton's emails put our country at risk. [From his convention speech](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974): 

>And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server  deletes 33 000 of them so the authorities canÕt see her crime  puts our country at risk...

And in [another speech:](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/22/donald-j-trump-foreign-governments-probably-blackmail-file-hillary-clinton-emails/)

>ÒHer server was easily hacked by foreign governments  perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China  **putting all of America in danger** Ó Trump explained. ÒThere are the 33 000 emails she deleted. While we may not know what is in those deleted emails  our enemies probably do.Ó

B) Having already acknowledged that her hacked emails put ""all of America in danger."" Further  he strongly implies that our enemies having those emails would be a bad thing. Today  he requested that a foreign power and non-ally [*find* those same emails and release them to the public](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html?_r=0):

>ÒRussia  if youÕre listening  I hope youÕre able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing Ó Mr. Trump said  staring directly into the cameras. ÒI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.Ó

C) He is advocating for something that he has explicitly said puts the country in danger and his only possible motive for that is personal political gain.

To be clear  I am not arguing that Trump should be tried for treason as I'm not familiar with the legal threshold for a charge  but rather that his actions are treasonous in spirit and nature.

"CMV: Not only should prostitution be legalized, but it's alarming that it isn't already.","This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points:

It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as doing so does not infringe on the rights of others.

Prostitution is  presumably  an agreement among consenting adults. I'm not trying to defend anything other than exactly this.

There is virtually no immediate difference between prostitution and pornography. Simply adding a camera with the intention of creating porn somehow makes the act legal. 

The reason it is so alarming is that it is a blatant violation of our rights to our own bodies. It's the government tacitly saying they are the ultimate authority as to who we have sex with and under what circumstances it is permitted.

Most importantly  since people will do it anyway  making it illegal forces it underground (just like drugs). In the places where it is legal it can be heavily restricted in ways that prevent disease and the rights of the workers can be protected. 



Since I don't think I've ever heard a single decent argument against this  I'm interested in having this deeply held belief challenged.

Edit: I'm having a hard time responding to everybody but I really appreciate everyone's input. My perspective on this issue has increased immensely even if my position hasn't really changed. I no longer think it's ""alarming"" that the US hasn't shifted it's consensus to my way of thinking.

"CMV: If you attack someone, they are well within their rights to use ANY amount of force to stop you. They shouldn't have to risk their own life by hesitating for legal reasons when they did not initiate the violence.","It seems insane to me that I can wantonly attack a stranger  get shot/stabbed in retaliation  and then get THEM put in prison because ""I didn't have an equally dangerous weapon"" (or whatever the stupid fucking laws are in your given state). If a stranger attacks me  I have every right to assume they mean to do me harm up to and including fatal injury - the legal ramifications of HIM attacking ME should not be something that I am responsible for considering. 

What am I missing here? Is it that hard to just not assault strangers if you don't want to die or be seriously injured? Why is assaulting someone not an act that immediately forfeits your right to press charges? Assuming of course that the question of who initiated the attack is clear-cut  for simplicity's sake.

*edit: /u/Freeloading_Sponger's response below forced me to consider the fact that such leniency would make the task of getting away with murder a trivial one (since all you'd have to do was kill them with no witnesses). While I still believe that someone who initiates an assault on another person has forfeited their right to not be killed  in the interest of preventing abuse of the law I do recognize that a certain amount of scrutiny must necessarily be placed upon the defendant.

*edit2: Productive and enlightening as this conversation was (thank you to all who replied)  I have to say I'm a little shocked at the downvotes I received. I don't give a shit about karma  but I thought this sub was less prone to that kind of opinion-based voting. I won't judge it on one thread  but still it's a bit off-putting. I've been very open about my perspective and others' and have awarded 3 deltas; what exactly did I do that warranted downvoting? If it's because I foolishly neglected to cite the supposed ""stupid fucking laws in your given state "" why not just criticize me verbally (as well you should)? Regardless  I enjoyed the exchange and benefited greatly from it.

**edit3*: woah. Didn't expect such a massive influx of posters while I was at work. Rather than respond to everyone individually  I'd just like to say to all the people putting words in my mouth that (aside from the fact that I already explained in my previous edits that I'd seen the major flaw in my logic) I was mainly considering situations in which there is a reasonable chance that lethal force could/would be used against you by the attacker. Stop fucking telling me I want to shoot a soccer mom in the face - you know damned well that's not what I was advocating. I will no longer respond to people who come at me with that shit  since you clearly didn't bother to read my edit or any of my responses to other posters. Forgive me for voicing a perspective in *CHANGE MY FUCKING VIEW* that wasn't airtight. If I just wanted to be allowed to wantonly murder people  don't you think I'd post something like this in www.castledoctrine.org or some shit? I have already admitted the error of my judgement on the matter  and I realize now that I'm not really in much disagreement with most self-defense laws; I simply hadn't considered all the factors when i thought I wasn't. Despite the (understandably) controversial nature of the post  I'm still a little shocked at the hostility. I will not respond to anything else that implies I have a desire to kill people for the sake of it  and I'll try to not become jaded about posting shit here in the future.

"CMV: it's hypocritical to support an increase in the military budget, but oppose public healthcare on the grounds that nobody is entitled to use other people's money.","Months ago  I had a conservation with an acquaintance who supported Trump's 34 billion increase in the military budget  because the U.S has the responsibility to ensure the security of all it's foreign allies. Fair enough. 

Recently  he posted a picture of Rand Paul alongside one of his quotes. The one where he insists that public healthcare is basically the same as dragging him (a physician) out of his house and forcing him to treat a patient free of cost. 

I just don't get it. It's fine if you think that nobody is entitled to use your money for something you don't want it to be used for  but how can you then be all right with using other people's money to pay for something they don't want it to be used for? Sure  you should be able to say that a kid with cancer doesn't deserve to be treated with ""your"" money  because your money belongs to you. But when you say that and you go on to support an overinflated military budget  you're basically saying that the collective resources of the nation should be spent on defending S.Korea and Israel's borders before they are spent on treating a kid with cancer.

"CMV: If a religious person truly believed their texts were sacred, they would devote a far greater amount of time to studying them","I find it very very strange that religious people (of any denomination  but I primarily encounter Christians) claim to believe that their text is sacred  directly created or somehow influenced by God  and not merely a divine post-it note or shopping list  but instructions on life and so on  yet very few of them commit any serious amount of time to reading or learning about it. 

I feel that most religious people (and by that I mean people who genuinely believe in it all) fall into these categories:

* Cultural absorption: My community believes in the Bible  so as long as I act with the values taught in my community that's good enough.
* 
* Knowledge by proxy: I'll let someone else tell me about it  they're probably more capable of telling me what it means anyway.

If someone actually felt an object was sacred  it would be immeasurably more important and valuable than anything else in the world. More than college  more than the latest novel  more than socializing  etc. I for one would drop everything to focus exclusively on it and any other action  given confidence in that knowledge  seems insane to me.

In this sense I feel like older religious traditions (Jewish Torah scholarship  Muslim memorization of the Quran  Christian monks secluding themselves for religious contemplation and study  etc.) which placed extreme emphasis on their holy books were acting far more rationally.

To give an analogy for how I feel  it would be like if I was sitting on reddit and a giant glowing hand burst through my bedroom wall and began to write a letter on my wall for me starting with ""Dear Bezant "" and I just thought ""Ehhhh  I wonder if there's any funny new memes today?"" then a few days later asked my roommate if anything in the letter seared onto my wall seemed important.

**Edit:** Thanks for the debate all! I'm heading to bed  but some further thoughts that occured to me while talking with everyone.

Have sacred texts somehow entered the mundane realm by being such a fixture of everyday life  that the human mind for some reason almost always refuses to consider it remarkable  even if it genuinely believes it is the most unique thing on earth?

I'll do my best to answer any new counterarguments tomorrow.

**Edit 2:** Wow this is still at the top! 

I'll post /u/greygoop8's version here  I think he captured it in a way that doesn't evoke all the specific religious arguments:

>I don't know if you are really appreciating what it would mean to believe a text is sacred.

>Think of this scenario. You get contacted by an alien who takes you on a tour around the universe showing off technologies that look like magic to you and that break what you thought were the rules of the universe. They can manipulate time  space  energy and matter in ways you never imagined  nevermind thought possible. They tell you they've been around since before the big bang and have figured out how to survive the multiple heat deaths of the universe that they've already lived through. The knowledge they have about the universe makes your current knowledge look like that of an insect compared to a human.

>Then they give you a book  in your native language  that's about 1 000 pages  written in a way to try to help you better understand the universe and explain to you the greatest mysteries of life.

>How could you not devote all your energy to reading and studying that text until you know it inside and out?

>If I believed the bible was the direct word of an omnipotent being trying to give me a message  I wouldn't put it down. I don't know how anyone who actually believed a text was divine could do otherwise.

So  if you want to CMV  I would suggest arguing one of two points:

a) to the human mind  a religious text isn't 'divine' in the same way the alien's gift would be. 

b) a relatively disinterested reaction to such a gift is reasonable

CMV: It isn't just that women are underrepresented in STEM - men are underrepresented in other fields.,"(STEM - science  technology  engineering  mathematics. I am a male living in the United States.)

I should preface this by saying that women are just as capable as men in STEM. I unequivocally reject the notion that men are somehow ""better"" than women at STEM or that women ""can't handle STEM"".

I want to see gender equality in all fields. But I think that pushing women to pursue STEM careers while giving men no reason to change their future paths is ineffective and actually detrimental to the goal of gender equality.

First of all  there are far more women attending college today than there are men. According to [this](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_303.70.asp) data from the Department of Education  there were about 9.5 million women enrolled at a university in the United States in 2015 compared to 7.5 million men. This gap has been increasing with time  and it is projected to continue increasing - by 2026  there will be 11 million women enrolled compared to 8.3 million men (assuming trends hold).

Also  the gender gap in STEM fields is definitely closing. [This](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/truth-women-stem-careers) article demonstrates that while the gap is still large in the computer sciences and engineering (composed of about 20% women) the gap is far smaller for other fields. Mathematics and social sciences are about 50% women  biosciences are about 60% women  and psychology is almost 80% women. 

Conversely  there are fields where women dominate rather heavily and men are not encouraged to enter. According to [this](https://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/QS-womenwork2010.htm) data from the Department of Labor  social workers and elementary/middle school teachers are composed of 80% women  and registered nurses are composed of a staggering 91.1% women.

Social and gender norms play a large part in this disparity  much in the same way these norms led to the STEM disparity. [This](https://www.aaeteachers.org/index.php/blog/757-the-teacher-gender-gap) article from the Association of American Educators talks about the stigmas against male teachers  especially at the early grades  where the social image of male ""disciplinarians"" does not align with teaching of younger children  who are not harshly disciplined. Indeed  an elementary school teacher who comments on the article goes so far as to say that many people think of child molestation when thinking about male elementary school teachers. Another factor is the pay difference - men are often seen (incorrectly) as ""breadwinners""  and are pressured into higher-paying fields than teaching.

And [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/upshot/why-men-dont-want-the-jobs-done-mostly-by-women.html) New York Times article shows projections which demonstrate that  should trends continue  over 80% of the jobs added in the next seven years in occupational therapy  home healthcare  nursing  and genetic counseling will go to women. 

Now  there is nothing wrong with women getting these jobs. But I think that if men are encouraged to enter other fields just as women are encouraged to enter STEM fields  not only will we see more equality in jobs like nursing  we will also see more equality in STEM. Women already make up the majority of college students - if (hypothetically speaking) each gender was evenly distributed across all programs  there would be more women than men in every single field.

So  am I missing something or are people just ignoring this side of the picture? Change my view!

**EDIT**

Multiple users have pointed out that my title is atrocious. Upon reflection  I agree.

It should be more like:

**CMV: Men should be encouraged to enter non-STEM fields.**

Sorry about that.

**EDIT 2**

I have awarded a delta to /u/mr_indigo because he has expanded my view on the issue. I was initially more concerned with the changing the stigma against men in non-STEM fields much in the same way society has been trying to change the stigma against women in STEM fields.

/u/mr_indigo showed me that there was a larger economic side to the argument. While other users also brought up economics  I felt the argument was fully crystallized only by /u/mr_indigo. He/she connected it to an affirmative-action-like idea  where encouraging women towards STEM is a part of alleviating women's historic economic disadvantage. In this context  there is no parallel argument to be made for men  even though other arguments about stigma are still valid.

Thus  /u/mr_indigo has changed my view.

**EDIT 3**

I have awarded a second delta to /u/AssBlaster_69 for expanding on the economic side of the argument. His anecdote about being a male nursing student helped me see the parallels with my knowledge of anecdotes of women in STEM industries.

And as a student  /u/AssBlaster_69 has a unique perspective on the issue that I find incredibly valuable.

**EDIT 4** (Nov. 10  2017)

At this point  if I don't respond to you  it's because I feel that the issues you bring up have already been addressed elsewhere in the discussion.

CMV: Testimony from the family of a victim during sentencing in a murder trial is unjust and has no place in our court system,"I don't know if this phenomenon is universal in the US  but in a number of places  family members are called to testify during the sentencing phase of a murder trial.

They are not witnesses to the crime -- they are there purely to help make a case for or (rarely) against a harsh penalty. I believe this is a relatively new thing  pushed by ""victims' rights"" groups (which could make a whole new CMV in and of themselves).

This boils down to the following: if you have a family that loves you  which a jury finds sympathetic  your murderer will get a harsher sentence. Empirically  there is less of a punishment for killing an orphan than someone with parents. A jury is likely to sympathize with the family of a murder victim if they are of the same race and class.

Everyone is entitled to equal protection by the law -- and I think that extends to murder victims. If we have a system where some victims are  in effect  treated as more important than others  I think that's against the principles of our justice system.

"CMV: That people who opt out of being an organ donor on their drivers licence should not be eligible to receive organs, or at least put at the 'bottom of the list'.","I am only aware of one reason that would prevent some one from being an organ donor  and that is religious. 

I am absolutely OK with people being given the choice to opt out of being an organ donor (though part of me really thinks it should be mandatory or something)  however  those people then surely cannot expect to be an equal priority to receive organs. It just seems so unfair to me.

I would love to hear from any one. It would be especially interesting to hear from some one who has chosen not to be an organ donor  but would be OK with receiving an organ if necessary. 

Thanks CMV!

Edit 1: I am aware using the correct effect/affect is a challenge for me. Please disregard mistakes. 

Edit 2: Whoever got angry at me for some comment I made and went and down voted all my stuff  lol. You need to take it easy. 

Edit 3: Thanks for all the great comments. You have definitely changed my view regarding complications and exceptions making this proposed system not a very good idea.

I still believe that anyone unwilling to donate their organs after their death is some what selfish and that we need to make the organ donation system an opt-out one. 

But no one can play God and deny health care to any one  no matter how selfish they are.

"CMV: Using the words ""right"" and ""left"" to lump radical and moderate political groups together is unhelpful","I see little benefit in lumping all left-wing or right-wing groups together and describing them with one term.  It leads to people discussing groups such as Antifa or Neo-Nazis using the general terms of ""left"" or ""right"" instead of their specific names.  This leads to needless division and hostility as moderate groups are called out for the actions of radicals.  I don't see why people can't just call them ""leftist extremists"" or ""right-wing radicals"" instead of using a term that can describe half the country.

**NOTE**  I am not saying that partisan political groups can't be left or right wing.  I am saying that blaming their actions on the ""left"" or the ""right"" instead of placing the blame on those specific groups is unhelpful.  

""Unhelpful"" in this CMV is referring to political dialogue and discussion.

"CMV: Next time there is a school shooting, the killer's name and picture should not be published by any media, and coverage of the event should be kept to a minimum.","I feel very strongly that the main motivation for these killers isn't the pleasure they get from murdering kids  but the shock and disgust they subject the public to. They are psychopathic and horribly depressed  and instead of killing themselves outright they want to release some of the pain they have felt onto the world. So far  the media has played along exactly as these people want. They turn these people into celebrities  and for months after every shooting every media outlet talks about the shooting non stop. Edgy people on the Internet spread the person's picture around as part of some ironic joke  all the churches across the country hold daily prayer services or whatever. The whole country gets completely worked up and panicky and this is exactly what the shooter wants. 

The part that makes me the most angry is that a news station or magazine directly profits from publishing every single scrap of information they can get their hands on. You'll see pictures of the shooter from years before the event took place. These tragedies result in a profit for whatever news organization can deliver the most info to the ""grieving"" public  perpetuating the state of panic for longer and fulfilling these sick murderer's fantasies. It might sound drastic  but if a law was passed that treated these people like terrorists and forbid the media to give into their demands  I feel that the amount of shootings would go down.

CMV: The black community is perpetuating stereotypes and self-segregating itself.,"I am a young black male  who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. 

I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is a prevalent problem with minorities -- specifically African-Americans and Latinos receiving lengthier prison sentences and disproportionately being targeted by law officials. 

I also understand that my experiences do not relate to all of the black community. By that I mean  just because I was able to make it out of the 'hood' doesn't necessarily mean every black person is awarded that opportunity. 


However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle  wrapped in a mystery  inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight. 

Obviously I'm not going to be able to go into deep analysis of my views but I'll try touch on some view points.

* Mindset









Black people throughout American history have been disproportionately impoverished  and throughout the last 30 years have developed a mindset of ""hustlin"". Now I understand that ""hustlin"" can translate into any race/culture as just another medium in which to get money. But black culture seems to value poverty and the 'hustlers mentality'. If I turn on the radio to HOT107.5  I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype. ""Hustlin'""  is glorified while education is not. 

There is very little initiative towards the Arts  STEM  etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty. 

Hip-hop is attached to black culture  and it seems that black culture (which has churned out great literary works and ideas) cannot distance itself from hip-hop. I don't believe hip-hop is bad. Quiet the opposite  but it is the black community that has embraced the hip-hop scene and made the world associate it with us & crime/street life. Even TV shows portray this  everything from sitcoms to drama. You are less likely to find the token-black guy  and more likely to find the 'reformed thug'. 

Black people want to be included in mainstream society  yet reject it at the same time. We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises  but we also want black-only things. I believe you can't have your cake and eat it too. America works best as a soup  not a salad. 

The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime  yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs  criminals  yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.

/r/blackpeopletwitter  albeit funny  is also embarrassing because black people are again perpetuating a stereotype or being cast a stereotype. Tweets about is 'how fire is my mixtape  'bruh' 'nigga this  nigga that'. We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying ""nigga"" and ""bitch"" like it's a pronoun. Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people. The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again  creating polarizing opinions/slogans like ""All Lives Matter"" 


* Black nationalism

In my eyes  black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths. It is on the scale as 'white washing' history. Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by/for the black community. Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation.

i.e. ""Ancient Egyptians were black  Jesus was black  Mohammed was black  etc"" or teaching talking about slavery only in terms of black v. white. 


* Homophobia/Racism/Misogyny

As I stated earlier  the black community hasn't made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip-hop culture perpetuates. All I can tell you is from my own experience but homophobia and misogyny  seems to be rampant in the black community. Not so much in terms of violent actions but insults through social media and subtle homophobic/misogynistic remarks made on radio and TV.

CMV: Religion should not be given a privileged immunity against criticism,"Every idea  concept or value should be open to criticism  and as human culture evolves  some of our ideas and values must be left behind in the past in order to progress. People throughout history have held many bad beliefs  e.g. that the earth is flat  that some magical stones have healing powers  that the order of the stars determines the faith of a person (astrology)  that black or homosexual people are inferior. Clearly  at one point in history  these ideas became empirically falsified or rejected by reason.

Religions  however  uphold a set of ideas and concepts which donÕt follow this evolutionary logic of (self-)criticism. Most religions are not open to any fundamental change or criticism. Also on an interpersonal level  it is often very difficult to argue with a religious person. In the end one often gets the answer Òbut this is my personal belief  I can feel itÉ you are not all-knowing either  please leave me alone  and let me believe what I believe.Ó Religious people  or religions as such  react very agitated to critique and mostly donÕt take criticism seriously. They even demand that we respect their religious personal beliefs and thus give them a privileged immunity against criticism. Or as Sam Harris eloquently said it: ÒFaith itself is always  and everywhere  exonerated.Ó Atheists must be careful not to hurt the feelings of other religious people. Whereas arguments against pseudo-science are perfectly acceptable (socially)  arguments against religion are perceived as an act of intolerance.

I donÕt think this is a healthy attitude and inhibits human progress. Atheists  who strongly believe that without some religious dogmas the world will be a better place  have the right to aggressively attack the views of religious people. Especially in a growing secular society  in which the majority of people is convinced that religion is outdated  we should not shy away to destroy bad or empirically falsified ideas. Please note that my terminology of ÒdestroyingÓ and Òaggressively attackingÓ does not imply any physical violence  but merely a strong anti-religious rhetoric and politics (e.g. in a democracy people have the right to decide to no longer teach religion to young children at school  churches should not be given any longer taxpayers money to spread their ideas  etc.). I am aware that the tendency of one system of thought to dominate and destroy another system of thought is prima facie guilty of exactly the same fallacy as the many religious wars throughout history. Nonetheless  I think that today  in a democratic society  people can decide in a civilized manner to radically reduce the role of religion and establish society on secular and humanistic principles.

**EDIT (T+04.00):  I have nuanced my view in the following ways:**

* My original main claim that ""the immunity principle is internal to religion"" has reduced to the claim that ""societies as such are not very open to criticize religions because it is a social taboo  and people are afraid of being perceived as intolerant.""

* There is diversity ""within"" religion. It is untrue that religions don't ever change or reform due to criticisms. Though  I still think that change happens mostly ""within."" The boundaries are set *a priori* by the basic religious texts and ""external critique"" has little impact. 

*Thanks for replying.

"CMV: Banning the burkini (or burkhas in general) is repressive, racist, and against the freedom of religion","Edit: slight RIP inbox. I'll get back to this tomorrow. 

~~France is~~ Some cities in France are banning the burkha swimsuit  and I have three issues with this.

#Repression

Firstly  I do not believe that banning the swimsuit  as some believe  is ""freeing women from an oppressive regime."" In fact: the opposite: I see this as a contravention of the right to religious freedom. If a woman chooses to wear the burkha  it should surely be her right to do so  just as a Sikh can wear a turban  some Jews wear hats  and some Christians wear crosses.

Now  yes  some people may be forced to wear the burkha  even in foreign countries like France and England  but this is symptomatic of a larger problem; the burkha itself is not at issue here. Banning the burkha or the burkini on this reason would be like stopping people from attending churches because some people are made to go by their parents or spouses. [Standing over a woman and making her take her burkini off](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/24/europe/woman-burkini-nice-beach-incident-trnd/index.html) does not remove any oppressive influence from her  whether she freely chose to wear it or not. Taking a choice away from someone when their behaviour does not harm anyone else is a form of repression. And this is exactly what France is doing: a form of repression in the name of freedom.

#Islamophobia

My second issue is the message that this ban presents: it encourages the view that Islam is a misogynistic  oppressive  patriarchal regime  and paints Islam as something to be avoided. France has had to deal with some truly awful events in the past few years as a result of extremists in the name of Islam. But the failure to separate Islamic extremism from Islam makes us  on some level  no better than racists. It's crucial to understand that Islam does not condone the actions of terrorists or oppressive regimes  in my opinion. That there are [billions](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/22/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/) of Muslims around the world who simply want to live their lives peacefully in accordance with the way of life they believe is right  and do not want to commit terrorist acts.

It seems obvious  but I feel like the ban on the burkini is the first step to forgetting this crucial distinction. As soon as we start sending the message that it's Islam against Us  the terrorists have won. They've created terror. And now we're lashing out irrationally against those who have never done anything wrong; like those women who choose to wear the burkha swimsuit  or the burkha in general.

#Freedom of religion

My third issue with the ban  is that this is fundamentally against the freedom of religion. I've touched on this already  but I think it's important to frame this in terms of other religions: when have we ever asked a Sikh man to take off his turban or cut off his beard? Why would we? That's a choice he freely makes that harms no one  as a result of his belief. If a woman makes the free choice to wear a burkha  then that choice should be respected. [News presenters should have the freedom to wear a hijab and not be criticised for it](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/22/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/). If a woman isn't freely choosing to wear the burkha  and she's in a society which respects the choice of individuals to express their beliefs how they choose  then we should be working in other ways to help her  rather than simply banning all women from wearing burkhas. The ban is attacking the symptom  not the root cause. It's cutting out the lungs to stop lung cancer.

I'm not religious  though. I'm not a woman. So there's probably a lot that I'm missing from this complex issue. If there are more angles to this issue that I haven't considered  please enlighten me. CMV.

#Tl;dr

Banning the burkini swimsuit:

1. Is repressive in itself  despite the aim to counter repression
2. Allows a message of islamophobia to spread
3. Is against the freedom of religion

CMV: Not Sharing HIV Status with Sexual Partners Should Be Illegal Everywhere,"It's illegal some places and I think the effect is necessary just as requiring inoculations in order to go into public school is necessary. This is one case where obviously the good of the many overcomes the desires of the one. That is; quelling the spread of the disease  via law  protects the health of the masses in the same way that vaccines or antibiotics do.

This is a new issue to me though; so I'm not that certain  especially considering the effect on smaller individual populations; instead of thinking on the scale of a nation.

"CMV: Equal pay in sports for men and woman atheletes cannot be attained currently, due to economic factors associated with demand, not social injustice","I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info: http://www.cnbc.com/id/102811922) 

Now  while I agree that pay gaps are a problem in ~~general~~ some fields  sports is a different ballgame (no pun intended). As such  the success of a franchise is dependent on the supporters who pay money for tickets  gear  etc. If we were to look at attendance figures for the National Woman's Soccer League (NWSL) for 2014 compared to Major League Soccer (MLS)  we see a huge disparity in people attending games. 

Of course  this translates over to other leagues. The NBA draws more people than the WNBA  both live and TV ratings. The revenue of the NFL is exponentially greater than the Independent Woman's Football League. 

I'm not here to provide solutions to this  or look into why the mentality of America draws more into guy sports. Yes  I think that ladies should be paid equally. ~~I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do  if not better.~~ And of course  ladies have as much of a right to play in any sport and play it professionally. But (and yes here comes a South Park reference) ""...you can't expect people to watch."" My conclusion: the pay gap in sports is a consequence of economic revenue  rather than social injustice.

"CMV: Those who support Sanders, yet would vote Republican if Sanders isn't nominated, are not true progressives, they are merely anti-establishment.","There has been a lot of discussion on political subreddits  mostly /r/politics  about Sanders chances to win the nomination. The overall consensus stands that Sanders is hopeful  but not likely to win the nomination. However  I've viewed a disturbing trend among Sanders supporters that manifests itself with a lot of people promising to vote for Donald Trump or another Republican nominee instead of Hillary Clinton in the general election to spite the DNC.

This is crazy. Bernie Sanders is a progressive  and a staunch liberal. If one is in support of Sanders  then why would they ever vote for a conservative? Every single Republican nominee holds a majority of views that are strictly contradictory to Sanders policies. Whether it be funding government programs  pushing cultural and social programs and movements  tax policies  fiscal and monetary policy  etc. Sanders is opposite to nearly all Republican candidates. Trump may hold the same anti-establishment appeal that Sanders does  but that doesn't mean they are equatable in any way.

Clinton  for all her faults  is still a moderate-liberal. Her public policy would be less drastic  but still in the spirit of Sanders public policy. Those who would suddenly support a conservative because they couldn't get their radical liberal candidate  are not liberal or progressive at all. They are simply anti-establishment  and that is not a good thing. It means that they support nothing other than to go against ""the system."" But there has to be a system of some kind. Wanting to break the political system without offering an alternative or reform is irresponsible and detrimental to American society.

EDIT: So a few individuals have convinced me that there are a few ways in which one could justify voting for Trump if they don't get a Sanders nomination. I'd like also to clarify something. My insinuation within all of this is that it is irresponsible to be anti-establishment at all costs. I still believe that  but there are a few legitimate explanations for why one would vote Republican or Trump if they can't get Sanders.",298,3,3,17,27,"[['https://berniesanders.com/supermonday/20160229_gotvsupertues-1/', 'https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/20160222_electabilitygraphs_v3-1.png', 'https://berniesanders.com/supermonday/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=rd1602293'], ['who?](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/01/why-trump-and-sanders-share-mandate-universal-health-care)'], ['http://www.baen.com/chapters/axes.htm', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pournelle_chart'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressivism'], [""[here](http://www.cnn.com/election/2008/results/polls/#val=usp00p1)'s""], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/progressivism'], ['effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_effect).'], ['things](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/08/11/the_contradictions_of_trump_127733.html)'], ['http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/01/06/gary_johnson_is_running_for_president_as_a_libertarian.html'], ['johnson](http://www.ontheissues.org/gary_johnson.htm).', 'paul](http://www.ontheissues.org/ron_paul.htm)'], ['[union-busting](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ohio-unions-governor-idustre72u62w20110401)', 'abortion](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/john-kasichs-quiet-campaign-to-cut-abortion-access/)'], ['http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/09/16/donald_trump_suggested_vaccines_cause_autism_during_the_cnn_gop_debate_he.html'], ['http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/09/16/donald_trump_suggested_vaccines_cause_autism_during_the_cnn_gop_debate_he.html'], ['surplus](http://imgur.com/hou8pbc).'], ['http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-china-created-climate-change-2016-1', '[comments](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-global-warming_us_5601d04fe4b08820d91aa753),', 'http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/bernie-s/yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h/'], ['[1](https://audioboom.com/boos/2057050-show-270-poking-the-bear),', '[2](http://www.infowars.com/obama-admits-u-s-overthrew-democratically-elected-ukrainian-government/),', '[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rotwyp5no08)).', 'peace.](http://victorygirlsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/threat-to-world-peace.gif)'], ['[""widowmaker""](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/06/27/1889702/the-widowmaker-doesnt-care-if-this-is-nuts/)']]",0,79,1,Yes
CMV: A cheating spouse should not be able to receive alimony payments after a divorce.,"(I still think child support is obviously necessary  depending on who takes care of the child)

Basically  when you sign the contract of marriage  you are stating that you will not commit adultery. This is still considered illegal in 21 states  but even in the other states where it's not illegal  you have still signed a contract that forbids it. I think if you break the terms of the contract  you are giving up your right for equal financial protection under the law. I understand the need for divorce  but there is never a good reason to cheat. I don't see how it should be up to a judge to decide whether or not the other person should receive alimony. If your spouse broke the terms of your contract  it shouldn't matter what the judge's moral views are. I know this is obviously not the case in today's society  but my view is that it should be. I really don't have any technical/legal grounds as to why I believe this  but from my experience of being cheated on  I can never see an instance where this law of making you pay your spouse who cheated on you makes any sense whatsoever. If they weren't comfortable enough financially to handle themselves in the case of a divorce  they shouldn't have cheated. Again  my view is not in regards to child support payments

Edit: i just thought about cases where the couples were ""swingers "" and were both open to cheating. In this instance  I still think it's fair to pay alimony  since they were both in agreement of the open relationship",311,3,3,11,13,"[['false.](http://www.wheelercentre.com/notes/f62f0865e03a)'], ['http://info.legalzoom.com/can-prenuptial-agreement-voided-26384.html', 'http://www.divorce360.com/divorce-articles/law/advice/can-i-break-this-prenup.aspx?artid=890', 'http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5542093'], ['http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/03/how-safe-is-a-prenup-breaking-it-up-can-be-hard-to-do-lawyers-say.html'], ['http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2573609/prenuptial-agreements-legally-binding.html'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hearsay_in_united_states_law'], ['[here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/a-family-learns-the-true-meaning-of-the-vow-in-sickness-and-in-health/2011/11/04/giqaahyadp_story.html)'], ['diosdado](http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/97/470.html)'], ['http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/03/how-safe-is-a-prenup-breaking-it-up-can-be-hard-to-do-lawyers-say.html'], ['http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/feb/27/pre-numpial-agreements-legally-binding-divorce-law-commission'], ['[cannibalism](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/germany.lukeharding)?'], ['circumstance,](http://www.innocenceproject.org/causes-wrongful-conviction/false-confessions-or-admissions)']]",0,55,0,Yes
CMV: I believe universal healthcare should be a human right.,"This type of post has probably already been made a handful of times but I wanted to include some of my own thoughts. I live in the UK  so I have grown up in a country that does provide universal healthcare. I firmly believe in this model from an ethical and social standpoint.

I've recently started reading the book Freakonomics. I wanted to see some discussions of the book on reddit  and I came across an AmA of the author  Steven Levitt. Somebody asked him his views on universal healthcare  to which he replied;

'I'm not so sure about universal healthcare.

what i think we really need is for people to pay a big chunk of their own health care costs so the whole system starts to act more like a market and less like an entitlement.  when health care is 20% of GDP  we can't treat it like an all you can eat buffet.'

Now  I'm not ranting or saying I flat out disagree with his statement factually  because I do not know enough about financial economics to do so  but as somebody who believes universal healthcare ""should"" be a human right  or 'entitlement' as Steven Levitt has put it  I struggle to understand how humanity as a whole would benefit from persisting with privatised health care. 

Essentially  to change my view  I would need to be convinced that privatised health care actually does have longstanding benefits for humanity  and not just for the 'economy'. Perhaps sustaining the economy and longevity of humanity come hand in hand  but I've always felt privatised health care primarily serves the rich who own it  and to deny healthcare to somebody who cannot afford it seems outright inhumane  to me. Perhaps somebody could show me privatised healthcare actually does benefit humanity as a whole  and not just a small percentage. 

EDIT: I was asked to link the post that 'changed my view' the most  so here it is. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2wzag2/cmv_i_believe_universal_healthcare_should_be_a/covh1ws

Here is the post that I awarded a 'delta' quite early on. Admittedly I perhaps could have been more involved in the thread but I was quite literally overwhelmed with the amount of replies  to the point that the same types of responses were pouring through  deeming it almost impossible to identify which further posts would be deserving of another delta. 

Although my view is not changed in that I still believe as a society we should work towards everybody having 'free' access to basic healthcare  I am now aware of the implications of a 'human right'  and how that could have serious adverse effects. 

I'm sorry if I was not totally compliant with the rules of the thread  but overall I see it as a success as it made me see things in a different perspective  and perhaps others have learnt from it as much I have.

Thank you for all of your replies.

I think professors should have to be able to speak English clearly to get hired to teach. CMV,"There's a professor in my department whom I can barely understand when he speaks. English is definitely not his first language. I had him a while ago for a lower level course and I was able to grind my way through it but he's the only professor that teaches a high level course that I'm taking. It's not as simple as asking him to repeat himself when I don't understand  I would say that I can understand maybe 25% of the words he says. I think that the ability to clearly express ideas to everyone in the class is essential to being a successful teacher and should be a requirement for the job. Especially so in a course with many abstract concepts such as the one in which I'm enrolled.

I know this is very narrow minded and probably kind of bigoted in some ways. Other people seem to be able to understand him and I've heard people say he's one of the the best professors in the department. I feel like the ""correct"" way to feel about this is to admit that I'm the one who has a problem since my peers seem to be able to understand him.

"CMV:The argument against privacy ""I have nothing to hide"" is invalid","Many people argue against privacy saying if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear from a government looking through your personal details online. However I think that this argument is invalid.

1) Just because you have nothing to hide doesn't mean that governments should be allowed to look through your personal details. Just like everyone goes on Facebook (or Reddit) everyone goes to the toilet. That doesn't mean that want to have the walls of your bathroom made of glass so police can see in. Oh and if the police do not do a good job of making sure that only authorised people are allowed to see you on the loo the perverts can join in. Just like hackers could steal our data from the police.

2)""Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."" - [Edward Snowden](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CqqMRGWWgAEcOUV.jpg)

**edit:** 3) Lets say with all of that data the government's decide to call people in their software for selecting people manages to select 1 correct terrorist out of every thousand people (this is extremely accurate). If there are 20 terrorist in an area that means that 19 980 innocents are put through questioning designed to make the terrorists break and admit to being a terrorist.   

You do not need ""something to hide"" to want to not have your whole life put out before another human. You can still want to hide ""something"" even if it isn't a bad ""something"".

"I think that we should teach formal logic to very young kids in elementary schools before any math, or perhaps concurrently with elementary math. CMV.","I believe people are taught by school systems to think that math should be hard for them. The reason for this  in my opinion  is that even elementary mathematics involves a certain level of application  which makes things less basic and less intuitive than they are when one learns formal logic.

Here are a couple of Wikipedia articles which outline the basic ideas that I think should get taught:

[Propositional Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus)

And perhaps even some [Predicate Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic)

Essentially  students as young as first or second grade should receive instruction about what sort of valid inferences can be made based on the truth/false values of statements. One wouldn't even have to teach them the words 'predicate' or 'proposition' or anything like that.

It seems that mathematics are taught at early stages of schooling because people recognize the relevance that an ability to add  subtract  multiply  and divide will have later on in life  as well as the abilities to recognize relationships between shapes and units of measuring time  etc. However  teaching formal logic in a child-friendly way might provide more benefits  both to the child's ability to reason logically *and* his/her ability to master complicated mathematical ideas later in life.

One might say upon looking at a description of formal logic that young children are incapable of thinking so abstractly. However  I have to disagree with this right from the start. Performing simple mathematical operations involves some abstract thinking  but we make it easier via story problems (as long as the story problems turn out well-written).

Story problems can be written for things like formal logic as well. I attended a class once where the professor was telling us that he learned to program computers at age six. His secret was that his parents bought him books for kids that were secretly teaching logic. A typical scenario described by the book would say something like this:

*Peter asked his mother if he could go outside and play. His mother responded  ""If you wash the dishes first  then you may go outside and play"". Peter ignored the dishes and went outside to play for a while. When he came back inside  his mother said ""You were supposed to wash the dishes first  young man!""*

*Peter replied  ""You said that if I washed the dishes  then I could go outside to play. You never said what would happen if I didn't wash them.""*

Kind of corny  but it's teaching something that computer programmers have to understand: the logical relationship between their statements. What is expressed in the everyday statement is very different from what is expressed in the 'logical' statement.

Basically  I think students should be taught these ideas at a very young age--in fact  when they're so young that they don't even know they're learning it. If a teacher were very creative  he/she could compose teaching material that taught the basis and totally numberless rules of computational logic and the ways in which we track valid inferences and write logical proofs. Elementary math shouldn't be ignored  necessarily  but perhaps taught concurrently. If formal logic were taught in classrooms very early  higher mathematical concepts would not seem as scary later on and would not deter students or drain their enthusiasm for problem solving.

I'm afraid there may be details I've overlooked  so I want to at least hear the opinions of people who think I'm wrong about this. Tell me why it would be a bad idea.

"CMV: Hillary Clinton avoids criminal prosecution because of a corrupt FBI, and her presidency would be the epitome of a United States that is owned by corporations and foreign donors, and much of what she proposes is against our Constitution or a threat to national security.","Edit: I went to bed and woke up  and I have work  and have way too many inbox replies to be able to deal with them all. I had a good time  and thanks to all the responders. I posted a lot of views  and while not all have been changed  y'all did correct quite a few. Thanks  again!

I'm a soldier  and I want to be able to proudly serve under my next president. The only problem is I absolutely hate Hillary Clinton. Like  entirely despise her. Below I will post what I believe  and they are beliefs I don't want to believe in. Please change my views. In my oath of service I swore to obey the Constitution above the president. I don't want to spend the next 4-8 years believing I'm not following my oath.

I see her as a puppet to huge donors  such as massive corporations  and foreign nations like Saudi Arabia. She has no care for the actual American people. She gets away with ger crimes due to her power alone. Anyone else who has done even a fraction of what she's done would be locked away for life or executed.

The majority of the media is basically in her pocket and ignores everything she does wrong  while making everything any other candidate does headline news. It highlights how corrupt our media is.

There is evidence of voter fraud against Bernie Sanders and I worry she may attempt it again against Trump and Johnson. It undermines democracy itself  and frankly how little anyone seems to care about this pisses me off. She was losing in the polls until polling companies changed their algorithms  making it look like she has support when she doesn't. She's doing this to make her voter fraud less obvious.

Her proposed gun legislation is absolutely unconstitutional  and is a direct threat to our social contract as a nation and our ability to defend ourselves against other people  and most importantly  our government. I feel like if it were up to her  I would not be able to defend myself. Props to anyone who can change this view in particular. I'm a historian by education  and I know that it is against everything the founding fathers believed when they designed our nation. It's something I'm incredibly passionate about. All others aside  this alone is enough to make sure she never gets my vote.

While social issues are important  she devotes far too much time talking about social problems  and spends too little time proposing economic reform or foreign policy reform. And what foreign policy she does advocate  will likely be the same kind of interventionist meddling in other nations  arms distribution bullshit.

Syrian refugees are not our problem  and even if 99% of them are great people  there is still the chance of bringing in terrorists  which is unacceptable. All incoming people should be subject to the legal process of immigration. No exceptions.

Terrorism is a threat to our nation  and she downplays it as if it is not. Even if it happens infrequently  the fact that it happens at all is reason enough to take any necessary action.

DNC opponents are dropping like flies. They seem to be dying left and right. I don't see how it can be a coincidence.

Trump is far from perfect  but I think his policies are safer for national security  and with him  even if he says dumb things every now and then  I have no doubts about his unwavering patriotism  and as far as crime goes  he is far less guilty. This part isn't really in contention. I don't want this to turn into an anti-Trump-fest. I want to actually change my views of Hillary herself. It seems the only arguments I ever actually hear for Hillary are really just anti-Trump shit and have nothing to do with

"CMV: As a legal immigrant, I think it is justified that illegal immigrants should be deported back to their nation of origin","I am a legal first generation immigrant from a south asian country. My parents came to North America as scholarship students. They struggled  we started off very poor  they worked hard to become successful. When I see illegal immigrants getting deported I feel bad. But even though I feel bad  I think it is justified that they are sent back to their country of origin. There are legal means to do things. We are *all* after a better future for ourselves and our children though enhanced economic opportunities  but if you get caught doing something illegal  I don't see much reason to not deport.

"CMV: It is wrong of Google to editorialize search results by censoring specific topics, no matter how reprehensible they may be","Topic in question: Google has begun scrubbing Holocaust denial websites from it's search results.

http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/26/14083308/google-holocaust-denial-search-results-algorithm-change-removal

Now  I want to preface my CMV with this:  Obviously there are some insane beliefs that do not deserve the legitimacy of a spot at the table of rational discourse.  This is in no way meant to be an endorsement of the beliefs Google has censored  which I personally find reprehensible.  That said...

I'm not sure I like this change.  Obviously this is a super extreme example  but it has set a precedent that I don't think I agree with.  I ultimately think it falls on the responsibility of the reader to critically evaluate every piece of information they read  and for someone else to step in and curate that is crossing a boundary that I feel a **""search engine""** should not be crossing.  What if I am merely searching for curiosity sake  wondering to myself *""what is it that these crazy people believe  exactly?""*  There are a handful of viable reasons that results like that  no matter how awful  could hold value to the right people.*

Just because some information isn't worth being taken seriously does not mean I want a supposed neutral 3rd party deciding which information that should be for me.  Sure  it's a topic we can all agree on today  but it sets a precedent that I do not agree with.  For the sake of consistency  I would like to see them pull a U-Turn on this one.  CMV!

(* sidenote: there is a difference between a belief that is despicable and something that is outright illegal.  My thoughts on what Google should not be censoring does not preclude them from continuing to censor things that the law is clear on  such as child pornography  illegal drugs  weapons  etc)

"CMV: Telling children they are ""special"" is unnecessary and potentially harmful and should be replaced with teaching them skills like empathy and the value of hard work","Kids already naturally feel ""special"" and essentially narcissistic  so it's redundant to tell them they are special. That would plant a seed that could lead to entitlement or arrogance. 
""I've always been told I'm special  so it's ok if I just spend all day on my phone instead of being social.""
 Wouldn't it be much more valuable to inundate them with the value of empathy and hard work? 
Also special implies that the child is greater than the average  and that just isn't true for everybody   la the point from The Incredibles  if everyone is special  then nobody is.

CMV: Boy Scouts are not in the wrong for not letting girls join,"My friends girlfriend claimed that girls should be allowed to join the Boy Scouts since it is the 21st century and Girl Scouts doesn't do things like camping as often as Boy Scouts does. I have seen that their are several other people trying to get this to happen on YouTube. However I believe that Boy Scouts shouldn't allow girls to join for several reasons

1. Camping
On of the biggest issues I see with this is camping  I know for a fact that if the two organizations where combined issues of having boys and girls camping together would come up  firstly it would require more adult female leaders to attend  as unless they decide to change the rules  male leaders cannot sleep near female scouts according to Girl Scout Rules(which is sure the BSA would adapt) 

Similarly many parents would not feel comfortable letting their children go off to camps where they may have to stay with a person of the opposite gender

2. Existence of Girl Scouts 
This is a simple argument  the fact that an organization exists that counters the Boy Scouts defeats the purpose of expanding the BSA to girls  people who are trying to get girls to be allowed in Boy Scouts should instead focus on improving Girl Scouts to a similar standard as the BSA

3. Venture Crews
This is something that honestly should defeat any argument for girls being allowed in Boy Scouts  their already exists an organization that allows both boys and girls to be in the same organization and they can go on camping trips and high adventure camps  the only drawback is you have to be 13-14 (I think it may be completed 8th grade) rather than be 10 as Boy Scouts requires (5th grade). 

4. Male bonding
There are not many organizations left that allow boys to go do things with a group of guys  I know it shouldn't be the case  but tweenagers (I think that's the term for 14 and under boys) act differently around girls  usually acting in a few ways  Trying to impress them  being extra polite to a point of faking it  or just awkwardly. Boy Scouts was one of the only chances where you can do and learn things without the distraction of girls. While one may argue that now days this shouldn't matter but when you look around the school there are still plenty of groups that are either majority male or female  and there should be organizations that allows this

I know my arguments are not that great but I just don't understand why those petitioning don't go to the GSA or join a venture crew

CMV: The outrage over the planned HBO show 'Confederate' is not reasonable,"There has been a deluge of think pieces in my admittedly liberal-biased newsfeed on facebook about how the new show by the Game of Thrones creators is problematic. My problems with these arguments has three main thrusts.

1. **They ignore the ability and power of fiction to allow analyses and critiques of the things they portray.** It may be partially because I am a fan of speculative sc-fi  but I love stories that take absurd premises  or simple ideas to the furthest extreme  because they can lay bare pretty big truths.
 
2. **These pieces are hypocritical by omission for not protesting the 'Man in the High Castle' show.**  I understand that there isn't the same built in tension with people in the US saying the germans should have won the war  but it is a show with literal nazis running half the US  and many arguments are saying that confederate would be too much of a fantasy for racists.

3. **These arguments reinforce bubbles**. I want to limit the scope of this and not delve too much into fights over ""PC culture"" but it seems to me these pieces are really just written by progressives and aimed at progressives who get to feel good that someone is taking on those who enable 'the evil racists"". This does nothing to break down barriers or change the minds of those they disagree with.

"CMV: having a ""socialist"" attitude is the optimal, rational, way for mankind to survive and thrive with no casualities","I'm going to define left and right as two specific mindsets. Kinda broad  abstract way of defining them.

- ""Socialism""  the ""left""  in which a person is caring about not only its wellbeing but also the others'  as long as they don't clash  finding a reasonable compromise in which either of them can do whatever they want if it does not influence negatively the other. The product of work is redistributed so that in the long term the people living in the bottom parts of society is never poor or at risk  and everybody gets to keep most of their wealth anyway.

- ""Individualism""  the ""right""  in which a person cares about his own personal freedom and success  believing that life is a competition  a zero-sum game. People must adhere to the ""normality"": common sense  as in ""what things have always been"" is not to be doubted. Personal freedom is only limited so that people won't steal or kill or harass others. Private property is absolute; the market must not be limited.



Okay so: why should someone decide to join the right? The reason I've come with is that they're afraid of others' personalities  ideas  even existence  and is super unsure of their personal identity  sexuality  gender  status  etc. Considering that we have people in the world that are worth as much as the GDP of a small country  and that production of food  housing and medicines is plenty for everyone to live a decent life  why are we still considering it viable for the human race? Warfare  for example  has been invented so that a group of people could prevail ideologically  or economically  on another; if a group of people is endangered  and another would accept it and help it and find a way to cohabit  why war? Sharing is easier  does not kill people and culturally enrich usually.

I feel like all of us  for the sake of this planet and the human race  should have a ""Star Trek"" attitude in which we all try not to hurt each other; only ideas that endanger the well being of other people are to be denied. There are many ideologies that claim that we are in danger of being replaced  or hurt  or enslaved or whatever  by others. I'm a white  cisgender  bisexual  former middle class guy that could be referred to as ""privileged""  ""cuck""  ""forgotten"" person depending on the interlocutor: but I don't feel it at all. No one else other than some guy who is scared by the gay black communist bogeyman is going to hurt me.

I pay my taxes and I enjoy paying knowing that they are spent so that we can all be better together  as long as of course  they are reasonable. I also would like people to have equal  free access to education  health  market and medias (both 2 way and 1 way)  reasonably. I know it's hard to make a country work. But why aren't we arguing on how to solve issues such as climate warming  ageing demographics  poverty  hunger and nudging the details? By now public education should have taught us that hating on others is dangerous  and integration is possible if both parts are ready to concede that they aren't superior. Immigration is a non issue: there is plenty of land  food and materials. States should simply enforce human rights and self determination. 

Heck  even allow people to live in some sort of anarcho-capitalist enclave if they wish. The world is big enough and being wealthy makes people have less children and live longer  as proven by the demographics of western countries  Japan and China  so that no one really has to fight with the other. (Yes  society will be older and not so numerous  but we are going to be fine if everyone is feed and taken care of.)

We have seen where unrestricted capitalism has taken us. We know how shitty is to be poor. So why are we such assholes to each other? It's okay to have different ideas  even calling each other slurs  but why people vote for hurting other classes of people? Yes  they want to live better  but why is wealthy people voting so that poor people gets even more screwed? Why a 400 million people country/union is so scared of 200 thousands people fleeting from war and poverty? Why  if we really are so incompatible  aren't we throwing money at the other nation and stop it? Why are we still thinking that personal success is the key to solving every single issue? Why unlimited free market when in about 100 years it still didn't solve poverty  sickness  and so on? Why fight when it only ends in people getting more and more miserable? Capitalism won't make everyone a billionaire. It barely provides some sort of personal security.

It's so damn irrational to me to argue that free market is going to solve everything and people should be afraid of others. My view is that socialism  specially if it does not mean full on communism  is the only rational solution to society; the rest is misinformation  egoism  or straight on evilness. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone. Of course my opinions are kinda naive and limited. I'll try to read all the posts.

CMV: Televangelists are mostly con artists and should be investigated by some government body.,"disclaimer: I am not talking about your pastor in your neighborhood church. I am probably not even talking about a lot of Megachurches (though there is definitely overlap).

I am specifically talking about the pastors that get nationwide TV time. Your John Hagee  Pat Robertson  Jim Bakker  Creflo Dollar  etc. 

Now I get that religion and faith are hard to quantify and i can't say that they are selling invisible products. What I will attack is their methodology of Scripture  the legal lines they cross  and of course the results. 

Now the majority of televangelists live in really nice houses and have nice cars  clothes  and other benefits like private jets. No law saying that they can't own nice things but how do they acquire it? They get people to give them money in exchange for a future blessing. 

In USA we have prosperity doctrine. This is the Religious belief that if you give money to the church  God will reward you with five  ten times your donation. Televangelists milk this doctrine for what it is worth. 

They will use tactics saying things like ""I know you are on your last $1 000 but give it to us and God will bless you with more money than you can imagine"". If you are a person of faith  sounds like a good wager. The problem is that this money obviously goes into the pockets of the minister and other leaders of the ministry. 

They often follow up asking for more and more money from donors. Now this is definitely the work of a con artist. Now let's go another step. Most of these groups do not pay taxes. They are registered as 501c(3) and as a non-profit  don't pay taxes on their donations. 

Well one rule of all non-profit is to not get political. Well this doesn't stop them from endorsing candidates. In and of itself this doesn't bother me but to quote George Carlin  if you want to get so involved in politics then pay your admission fee. 

Many televangelists ""sell"" products. Now they don't really sell the product. They ask for a donation and in exchange you get this gift. This helps them skirt some tax laws. 

If this were a business or a charity  at some point I feel like the IRS or law enforcement would investigate them. There have been some watchdog groups that have exposed them but it rarely goes beyond exposure. Their ""ministry"" continues without issue. Only person I can think of who got their come uppance was Jim Bakker and he is back at it again. 

I am open to hearing how televangelists are actually benefitted the world.",110,2,3,8,11,"[['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xjavzxxg'], ['https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_senate_inquiry_into_the_tax-exempt_status_of_religious_organizations'], ['absolutism](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/two-views-speech)'], ['notices.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsngmyqyzvi)'], ['http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119493/private-jets-13-mansions-100-000-mobile-home-just-dogs-televangelists-defrauded-tens-million-dollars-christian-network.html', 'https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahukewjh8a3zh8jqahuc02mkhacbak8qfghkmac&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tithing.com%2fblog%2flist-of-pastors-use-or-own-private-jets-and-mansions%2f&usg=afqjcnfvtqnk0reqxsbod2pc56zhfnl85a', 'http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/5/kenneth-copeland-jesse-duplantis-defend-private-je/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adh2dgsxjss'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart']]",1,21,1,Yes
I believe police officers should be held to a standard at least twice as high as normal citizens when they are caught breaking the law. CMV.,"Let me preface this by saying that I do not believe that *most* officers are bad people. Most are just good men and women trying to do a hard job. However  I believe that a minority of officers abuse their power and get away with it  and thus police as a whole must be held to a much higher standard than average citizens. This  in my opinion  is the only way to protect citizens from abuse of power.

Police drive recklessly by tailgating  speeding  and weaving through traffic  and I can only find one instance of an officer actually being punished at all. Even then  he was given only [100 hours community service and a $3300 fine](http://www.officer.com/news/10780221/miami-officer-fired-for-leading-120-mph-chase). An average citizen would have lost his license for driving at nearly double the speed limit and would have faced jail time for leading a police chase and resisting arrest.

Officer Tony Bologna [wasn't charged at all](http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/da_wont_prosecute_infamous_ows_pepp.php) for his assault and battery of two women during Occupy Wall Street. Battery in the Second Degree in New York is knowingly and recklessly intending to cause physical injury. It's a Class D felony. (Nevermind the assault charges that would go with it.) An ordinary citizen would be facing up to 7 years in prison  but Bologna wasn't even charged.

In LaGrange  Missouri  no officers were punished after being caught on tape [shooting and killing a dog](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/06/19/video-shows-missouri-cop-shooting-restrained-bulldog/) that wasn't threatening them. An average citizen who shot and killed a dog on the street would face community service and a fine (or even jail time) for animal abuse.

Two cops in California were cleared of any wrongdoing by an internal probe after [shooting a man 12 times  killing him](http://ktla.com/2013/04/05/verdict-reached-in-douglas-zerby-wrongful-death-lawsuit/#axzz2lAUk0lTd) for turning around with a water hose in his hand. The police did not announce themselves  and he was not aware of their presence until seconds before his death. An average citizen who snuck up on a man and shot him twelve times would be charged with first-degree murder.

Put simply: No matter the complexity of creating and enforcing such a stricture  police should be held to a standard at least double what an average citizen would face when it is proven that they violated a law. I believe that it must be this way in order to protect the rights and liberties of the citizens of this country. Change my view.

"CMV: University is the new general education, and like general ed should be publicly funded","This CMV is specific to the United States  though I welcome those from outside the country to bring their perspectives on the issue to bear.

Maybe I'm just bitter trying to crawl out from beneath the suffocating mountain of private student loan debt I'm in  but I'm pretty sure this isn't something anyone should have to deal with. That said  my actual argument has a more historical basis than this.

* Though literacy in the United States has always been fairly pronounced  this was not the case throughout the Western world. [This chart](http://ourworldindata.org/data/education-knowledge/literacy/) shows the literacy rates by year in a smattering of Western countries  stretching back to the 1500s. Once  literacy was the sole purview of the nobility and the clergy. Now it's an expectation of almost anyone in our country.
* In pursuit of this  general education has become publicly funded. While private educational facilities do exist  public schools provide education from ages 5-18  elementary school to high school  using public tax dollars for funding. Tax funding is particularly notable because it provides funding based on the health of the local economy  which encourages a unilateral increase in said health. That isn't to say that system is flawless; it does mean that areas without a healthy local economy are comparatively left in the lurch  but it's *something.*
* In the most important ways  a college degree is the new literacy. Children are raised by and large with the assumption that they will at least attempt to attend university  that this is the one true path to gainful employment. To wit  only 36% of jobs by 2020 will accept only a high school diploma (or less)  most requiring at least some college  if not an associate's degree  a bachelor's  or higher. (https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Recovery2020.ES_.Web_.pdf page 4).
* University  though  is largely private. There *are* public universities  but they're not fully publicly funded  still requiring a significant  personal  financial investment.
* The expected financial investment [has spiked](http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fees-and-room-and-board-over-time-1975-76-2015-16-selected-years) over time. Private four-year universities have increased in cost by a factor of three  while public universities have raised their tuition by a factor of four since the 1975-1976 school year. This is in contrast to the response to the demand for literacy and general education  for which the financial burden has remained subsidized and proportional.
* Combine this with predatory student loan practices and you have a disenfranchised generation of debtors rising out of university into a hostile job market. It's been ""improving "" but recent graduates still face high unemployment numbers (http://www.epi.org/publication/the-class-of-2015/).

So  there's my piece. Hit me with your best shot(s).

"CMV: Marijuana, if legalized, would be less damaging to society than sugar.","Marijuana is banned from society because it is believed that it will cause too much harm. This argument is not fair because people don't put this level of scrutiny on other things that we consider regular parts of society. In lieu of arguing for alcohol  I chose sugar because it is considered safe enough to market directly to children. Marijuana would cause less damage to society than sugar does now because sugar is linked to a much longer list of diseases  both mental and physical. The most convincing studies for long term damage from marijuana relate to those who began smoking as teens. This comes with the knowledge that areas where marijuana was legalized saw a decrease in teen use.

CMV: Advertisements for prescription medications should be illegal,"I'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind  the reason that these medications can only be used when prescribed by a doctor  is because they are volatile substances  and only  medical expert is qualified to determine which patients really need them. 

I can't imagine what good these ads do. If someone is sick  she should go to her doctor  who will decide what medications will best treat her  if any. Prescription dug ads simply cause patients to think they need a drug they perhaps do not  and it puts doctors in a difficult position when their patients request a specific drug that the doctor doesn't feel they need.

"CMV: The ""If you can't pronounce it then don't eat it"" or the ""if you don't recognize it neither will your body"" rules for ingredients in processed foods are ignorant and should be ignored.","Most people aren't educated enough to make decisions on what they want to put in their body based solely on the ingredient list.  I once witnessed a woman rant about the ""ascorbic acid"" that was in pre-sliced apples that were being sold.  (Ascorbic acid is literally vitamin C and used as an anti-browning agent).  She went on and on how she couldn't believe that someone was trying to sell her food with acid in it.  (Nearly everything we eat has acidic components  natural or not).  There was a survey conducted that showed that people were against the inclusion of ""Dihydrogen Monoxide"" in foods.  Dihydrogen monoxide is simply a over-complicated way to say ""water.""  But since it was an unfamiliar term  it sounded dangerous.  There are even ingredients that if you look up on the internet you will find are poisonous  however the missing information is the dosage.  For many of these ""poisonous"" ingredients  you would have to eat ONE MILLION times the amount that is in one portion to see any adverse affects  let alone death.  Too much of practically anything could be poisonous.  You can die from drinking too much water (and it's not as uncommon as you would think).

EDIT:  Seems like the consensus is that while these rules aren't perfect  people who are not exactly educated in nutrition need some sort of rule to follow.  It would be helpful if there were a better rule that encouraged doing research on unknown ingredients.

CMV: A $15/hour national minimum wage is a really bad idea.,"I run an animal hospital  we have a small kennel  a cleaning staff and a bunch of technicians. 

Currently  the average staffer makes about $12 per hour. Raising the minimum wage would increase my payroll by 20% and I'm not thrilled with that idea. Why not?

Because the people I hire are often inexperienced  uneducated and/or have some restrictions on working (kids in school  they can only work these hours or those hours  limited mental capacity  etc). Hiring these people is okay with me because the jobs like cleaning cages and walking dogs and mucking stalls are very simple and require very minimal training. Some of my employees don't make much but they aren't asked to do very much and their hours are often very flexible. Work with animals in this way can be very forgiving and is often very rewarding. I find most people in my employ seem to like the work.

If I have to pay $15/hour  well  I can probably get better (more qualified  more experienced  better trained) people for that much. If my bare minimum is $15/hour  then suddenly it makes sense to ignore the high school dropouts and part timers and inexperienced folks. For this new minimum wage I can get experienced assistants and certified techs. Why should I pay so much to others? This doesn't help people who have a hard time getting a job  it hurts them. I'll pass them over for somebody who can do the job for real. For at least $75K (rough estimate) a year in additional costs  I can do better than what I've got.

Why wouldn't people like me just start ignoring the folks who made the old minimum wage and instead go for more qualified people who want the job at this higher minimum wage? 

And before anybody tells me what a bad person I am for making money and not caring that people make less than I do  please remember I went to school for a decade and incurred a mountain of debt and I bear all responsibility for what happens in my hospital. I put in the most work  I bear the greatest burden  take on the most risk  am financially responsible for a dozen other people  and for all that I get to make the most money. So please help change my view without making me feel like a monster.",468,0,0,30,44,"[['benefits](http://www.dol.gov/minwage/mythbuster.htm)', 'shown](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/07/08/2256851/study-a-minimum-wage-hike-would-stimulate-the-economy/)', 'act**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0cb4qfjaaahukewif99snlc_hahvbnz4khwrgbjq&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sanders.senate.gov%2fdownload%2f15-minimum-wage-fact-sheet%3finline%3dfile&ei=xbrivywfmmhu-ahkwjmgaw&usg=afqjcnhtcilupzyenxscsqhjt1vvain-og&sig2=yz-zi29bwyilrsrvfutpga)', 'economists](http://www.budget.senate.gov/democratic/public/index.cfm/2015/7/top-economists-are-backing-sen-bernie-sanders-on-establishing-a-15-an-hour-minimum-wage)', 'industry](http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-high-public-cost-of-low-wages/)'], ['http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/04/10/3645268/new-evidence-buries-lie-about-seattle-minimum-wage/'], ['talk](http://youtu.be/sd67lkqxgrg).)'], ['money)](https://objectivismforintellectuals.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/wealth-is-not-money-monetary-wages-vs-real-wages/)'], ['[here](http://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2014/0714macewan.html).'], ['taxpayers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/04/15/report-walmart-workers-cost-taxpayers-6-2-billion-in-public-assistance/).'], ['way.](https://www.epionline.org/studies/r100/)'], ['this?](https://pastebin.com/64guvi2f/37827)'], ['map](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/census/newsroom/releases/2015/cb15-33_graphic.pdf).'], ['business](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/big-firms-pay-50-percent-higher-wages-than-small-businesses-study-shows/2012/11/28/e24a1f58-3970-11e2-a263-f0ebffed2f15_story.html),', 'businesses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/who-actually-creates-jobs-start-ups-small-businesses-or-big-corporations/2013/04/24/d373ef08-ac2b-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html)', 'businesses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/who-actually-creates-jobs-start-ups-small-businesses-or-big-corporations/2013/04/24/d373ef08-ac2b-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html)'], ['this?](https://pastebin.com/64guvi2f/27773)'], ['https://f247968a-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/isaacsorkin/research/minwagesorkin.pdf'], ['2007-2009](https://estore.aynrand.org/p/134/the-financial-crisis-what-happened-and-why-mp3-download).'], ['>kauffman.org/newsroom/**young-firms-lead-recovery-in-hiring-and-job-creation**'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socio-economic_mobility_in_the_united_states#current_state'], ['fortune](http://fortune.com/2015/04/13/who-makes-15-per-hour/),', 'less](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/08/who-makes-minimum-wage/).'], ['find](http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/characteristics-of-minimum-wage-workers-2014.pdf):'], ['source](http://www.city-data.com/income/income-seattle-washington.html),', 'average](http://grist.org/cities/in-seattle-the-rent-is-too-damn-high/)', 'workers.](http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/characteristics-of-minimum-wage-workers-2014.pdf)'], ['(http://fee.org/freeman/consumer-spending-drives-the-economy/)'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_saving_glut'], ['original](http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/11/young-firms-lead-recovery-in-hiring-and-job-creation-according-to-kauffmanfunded-census-brief)?'], ['this?](https://pastebin.com/64guvi2f/43181)'], ['[source](http://livingwage.mit.edu/)'], ['inflation.](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/03/volcker_recession)', 'equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fisher_equation)**'], ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimum_wage#debate_over_consequences'], ['(http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/11/inequality-america).'], ['world](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e35ca32a-08f3-11e5-881f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3klhowafx).', 'dropping](https://www.google.com/search?q=seattle+unemployment+rate&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8).'], ['http://images.cryhavok.org/d/23142-2/catling+gun.jpg'], ['decades](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/08/01/11998/the-failure-of-supply-side-economics/)', 'materialized](http://www.epi.org/blog/supply-side-abject-failure/)'], ['[source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0cceqfjaaahukewj-6v-cts_hahuiziakhddmdos&url=https%3a%2f%2fnces.ed.gov%2fsurveys%2fannualreports%2fdata%2fxls%2fdaylength0708.xls&ei=ej3ivf6zeiiygwtxmbnyca&usg=afqjcnh2olplrpekh2npezhchpbzitgpja&sig2=k_y5zoogrmdehwckosozvg).', '[$75,000](http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2013/2/teacher-pensions-sweeter-than-they-would-like-you-to-think)', '[59](http://www.newstimes.com/local/article/teachers-retiring-this-year-in-high-numbers-4628502.php)!']]",0,204,0,Yes
CMV: Government whistleblowers are an essential part of a functioning democracy.,"I am having trouble balancing the ideals of democracy and a government without secrets against the important of national security.  I want to stay in the abstract  but I will give an example to illustrate my point.  

When Edward Snowden leaked documents  he did so in the public interest because he felt the government  and particularly the NSA  were committing egregious violations of the 4th amendment.  In a democracy  if the government is acting in secret  it does not provide an opportunity for the people to take action (vote or influence politicians) and change their government.  Moreover  many politicians said that they were unaware of the information that came to light after Snowden  which suggests that part of the government  the intelligence community  is not only acting in secret from the people  but also from the other branches of government which are supposed to check its behavior (and some would argue acting in secret even from the president himself).  I believe  therefore  without people like Snowden  the people will lose control of their government  which is a central tenet of democracy.

What's the counter argument?  Why are intelligence communities exempted from whistleblower protections?  What's the check on that community?  Feel free to use Snowden as an example  but I would like to debate this in the abstract.  What about whistleblowers generally might be antidemocratic?

CMV: Adults and the elderly don't automatically deserve more respect than children,"I'm not trying to debate whether or not a child should act respectfully towards an adult or elder - because I believe that every single person should deserve to be treated nicely and with respect. However  I don't think that just because someone is older  or has lived a longer life  necessarily means that they are always in the right or that they deserve more respect than others. If a child's mother disrespects them  then they should no longer have to respect her  and that is that - they should not treat her rudely  but the respect that they have for her may be lower and that is fine.

I remember when I was younger I would always be very upset that adults could disrespect me  or treat me badly  and I'd still have to treat them like royalty - I don't encounter that as much now that I'm older  but it still doesn't make sense to me. I worry I'm not explaining my point well enough  but basically - I will respect anyone that respects me  too. Adults and elders should not get a free pass to disrespect children or anyone else  for that matter. Children should be given the same amount of respect as adults and elders  and adults/elders don't automatically deserve respect no matter what. If a child or anyone else doesn't respect an adult or elder  they should still treat them decently and in a civil manner  but they have no obligation to respect them.

Edit: First sentence is worded weirdly - In my mind there's a difference between acting respectfully and actually respecting that person. You can treat someone decently without actually holding any respect towards them.

CMV:We should all stop eating meat in the long-term,"I currently eat meat and enjoy it  love a BBQ  eat beef  chicken etc. but I would probably get used to it if a government came in that banned the meat industry.

Livestock  especially cows  take up so much of the worlds farmland that could be better utilized growing crops and also places like the Amazon are shrinking due to grazing.

Animal suffering is another thing  most animals which are used as livestock can feel pain and suffer in that job role. There may be a large initial cull but the benefit over time will reduce suffering in the long run. We can survive by eating non-meat foods  not necessarily vegan but not meat  there are lots of other protein sources and many people around the world are vegetarian and are not malnourished. One example which could be a counter-argument is that 30-40% of Indians are vegetarian and there are high levels of malnutrition in the country  but this is more a socioeconomic thing i.e. general food intake due to being poor  as well as the types of foods people eat such as cereals over things with more protein like eggs  as richer vegetarians in India are not generally malnourished.

Also red meat specifically has been linked to increased risk of some cancers  although of course the counter could be ""what doesn't cause cancer these days amirite!?""

So it would probably be better for the environment  suffering of the animals and our general health

I see belief in God as a major intellectual weakness. CMV,"I would love to be the understanding  accepting  arms-wide-open type who could honestly say ""I respect all beliefs."" But it wouldn't be true. I just don't. Belief in any of the Gods defined by major religions is a major intellectual copout  and I have trouble respecting a person who holds such a belief.

Philosophy is  in my opinion  the most important aspect of any person's being. It is literally a collection of the guiding principles by which a person chooses to live. How can I respect the intelligence of someone who chooses to just *not think about it for themselves*? Who chooses to let an ancient text with uncertain authorship or a hierarchy of clergy dictate their philosophy to them? This isn't even about whether or not God exists. It's just about how mentally weak I believe a person has to be to let their philosophy be dictated to them.

Please  help me see why I should be more accepting.

EDIT: Since a lot of people seem to be misunderstanding me  let me point you to this sentence above: ""Belief in any of the Gods defined by major religions is a major intellectual copout."" That is the core of the belief I'd like changed. I want to see why believing in one of these major Gods isn't a major philosophical weakness. Since I value philosophy extremely highly (as I said above)  a philosophical weakness  to me  translates to a major intellectual weakness.

I've also amended my argument like so: this belief being an intellectual weakness only applies *in the present*  the reason being that today we have so much less reason (ignorance  societal pressure) to believe or at least feign belief in a major God than centuries-old men and women had.

Hope that clarifies my position.

EDIT #2: I think I need to clarify one more thing. Having ""an intellectual weakness"" does not mean that a person is stupid. A person can be very intellectually strong in one area and weak in another. My view is that belief in one of the major Gods or  I suppose  dogmas is a philosophical weakness. Since I value philosophy so highly  this is a major intellectual weakness. Also  again because I value philosophy so highly  I have trouble respecting someone with such a major philosophical weakness.

"CMV: Police Unions and Sheriff Associations asking Waze (Google) to remove the Police Tracking/Tagging App has NOTHING to do with officer safety and has everything to do with revenues, ability to give out tickets, and so on.","NPR article here on the matter - http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/01/28/382013185/officers-ask-map-app-to-remove-police-tracking 

The Law Enforcement groups that want the police tracking/tagging feature removed/disabled claim that officer safety is the crux of their argument.  They site the instance the other month where that crazy guy shot and killed two NYC police officers...supposedly he had flashed that app to some folks hours before the fateful incident  but investigators have yet to conclude that WAZE has any major blame here.  This ask further reinforces that policing has very little to do with public safety  and has a lot do to with revenue streams. 

As DC Metro area resident who frequents the city on a pretty regular basis  I argue that finding a cop to gun down  if one was hell bent on doing so  no matter the city  **is not a tall order**.  Claiming the app aided the guy in NYC is nothing more than weak ""evidence"" to further an agenda.

I believe (due in part to observation of my own driving habits) that people will adhere to speed limits and drive less aggressively when they simply *think* that an officer is up a head.  

With people driving more cautiously  Police and Sheriff Departments/the counties they operate in stand to lose millions of dollars in fine related revenues over time as people will dramatically adjust their driving behavior if they think a cop in their general vicinity.  

As far as I see it  this is a modern adaptation/logical evolution of the use of CB radios (as stated in the linked article) or flashing ones lights to warn others.

"CMV: Screenwriters deserve far more credit for films than they get, directors deserve less","Full disclosure right off the bat: I'm a senior in high school  potentially going into screenwriting in college. I have a tremendous respect for directors-- even the very amateur classmates that I've worked with have a much better technical and visual understanding of film than I do  and  based on their work  they still have a *lot* to improve. I can write; I can't direct.



That being said  I think a lot of undue credit is given to directors of a movie. While I understand a lot of directors actually do write their films  so much of what is credited to a director at times is explicitly stated in the screenplay. Horrible example  since Nolan actually co-wrote the screenplay himself  but it's what I just finished watching-- the Dark Knight Trilogy. I've seen very well-regarded critics praising Nolan's *direction* for exploring themes of modern times (the struggle for hope  thin line between good and evil  etc) but almost all of this was subtext from the written lines  not a visual message. Exceptions include things like which side of Harvey Dent is lit when he's performing a certain action  but  honestly  I think a lot of amateur directors would have thought to do that.



Again  I think that directors deserve a ton of credit for shaping the film and creating the experience that the audience has (Maybe I phrased the title poorly  on closer inspection). And I understand the impact that a director has on a film (Tarantino films are clearly Tarantino films  Scorcese are clearly Scorcese). However  I don't understand when people talk about subtext  theme  character motivations  etc. in the context of the *director's* work. Obviously  there is going to be some visual symbolism  but the vast majority of the theme  subtext  etc. (pretty much anything that an English class could analyze a film for)  as far as I can tell  should be credited to the actors and screenwriters. 




Btw  since I mentioned that I'm an aspiring screenwriter  I should clarify-- this isn't about receiving attention for my work; that wouldn't really matter to me. I'm just confused by which credit is directed where; I'd want to know if I was completely wrong about the way the industry functioned before trying to be a part of it. And  obviously  there's going to be some rewriting and some changes on-set on the part of the director  but I think that the auteur theory (mentioned a few times on CMV) is a bit misleading. 



CMV!




Edit: Hey  everyone  really sorry I haven't been more active with my responses. I didn't think I had plans  but I just had to go somewhere for a bit. I'll try to reply to a few of you  but probably won't get to many. Good responses  by the way! I definitely at least gleaned some insight as to why the director might be valued so much more.

CMV: Schools should teach economics from a young age,"I think society would benefit from school placing a stronger (or indeed  any) emphasis on economics.

I don't mean teaching three-year olds the maths of it  but teaching it more like history.

It could cover the general schools of economic thought  the history of economic theory  and look at some real world examples from the past 100 years  or what have you.

The worst that could happen is that the kids then forget about it (like they forget other stuff)  and the best is that they have a greater understanding of the economy and grow into more well-informed voters.

**Edit:** Wow  a lot of replies. Thanks for all the responses  it was really interesting. I tried to respond to as many as I could  but a lot of comments touched on a similar theme. I haven't changed my view  but there is certainly some food for thought here. Thanks!

CMV: I think the Red Pill is mostly correct about women and society.,"I'm on the verge of ""taking the red pill"" and would like someone to talk me out of it if possible. It's not something that I like  but unfortunately after much thought I've discovered that what they say is mostly true. Perhaps it shouldn't be relevant but I am a woman and initially had the same reaction to TRP as everyone else. I thought they were just a bunch of men that hated women. Even though this might be partially true  I don't think this invalidates what they say. It is very upsetting to me that someone that hates me would be right  but that doesn't make what they say not true. Here is a list of things I think they are right about.   

*  We live in a very gynocentric society that is sexist against men. To give a few examples  men get longer prison sentences  are convicted at higher rates for the same crimes  and receive longer sentences for killing women than for killing men. (i.e. men are disposable)  

*  We always assume men to be the aggressor in any encounter. Women actually commit more domestic violence than men  yet we always assume it's the man who is abusive. Another example  ""My husband tells me what I should wear"" Sounds bad right? How about ""My wife tells me what I should wear."" The first sounds worse because we assume that a man with some power in the relationship will abuse his power  but we don't assume the same for women.   

*  Men have to be extraordinarily careful not to sound like they are blaming women whenever they vent any sort of frustration or emotion. For instance  ""Why do women like that asshole and not me?"" is something that you might find mocked in /r/niceguys or /r/justneckbeardthings. Yet if a woman says something like ""Why does that guy like the hot girl but not me?"" she would be most likely receive sympathy. Men have to be super careful in choosing their words  which is ironic because we encourage men to express their emotions more. Yet when they do  we shame them for it.   

* Male sexuality is considered shameful. Men are considered creepy if they have a blow up doll  for an example. Yet it's perfectly normal for a woman to have a collection of dildos. Men are shamed if they date much younger women  even if she is a  consenting adult.  

* Perhaps this isn't too controversial  but women are attracted to status  masculinity  power  and good looks. They are more attracted to a man if other women want him. They are no less superficial in their sexual preferences than men. Weakness is unattractive to women. Being an emotional  sensitive man is a death sentence in the dating world.  

* RPillers have a right to be angry and upset because men are almost always blamed for everything. They are assumed to be the bad guy. TRP is the one place that they can get relief from this and where women can be the bad guy for once.  I also feel like all women are partially responsible for their state. We should have been the ones to stand up and defend men. Men have a hard time  standing up for themselves without being perceived as weak or misogynist.   

* The more power the man has in the relationship  [the longer the relationship lasts](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01544589) and the more power the woman has  [the unhappier the relationship.](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/93/3/513/)  

I don't agree with all of RP views  and I hate that they are correct about these things  but I believe they are more right than the current mainstream narrative. Part of me wonders if I am just suffering from Stockholm syndrome  because I spend a lot of time reading their subreddit. CMV.

CMV: Ahmed Mohamed does not deserve nearly the amount of attention and praise that he's gotten over the clock.,"**Edit: I'm done replying. Getting PMs about how huge of a dick I am is really a tad bit too far  and I don't care nearly enough to keep up with it  or get downvoted on literally every comment I post on this thread no matter what  or go into arguments with people with things that are not close to trying to change my view  but proving themselves right and trying to be the smart guys on Reddit. It's really not that deep... As far as views go. If his rights were violated  then they should file a lawsuit and go to court. I feel the $15 million dollars is a bit much  and suing the city or school district does not directly punish anyone that was involved  but will hurt the residents and other students. The teacher  principal  and officer  are not being sued or charged  that's not right to me. Also  I still haven't heard why he should be getting all the praise he's gotten  when it wasn't science  but taking the plastic off a clock screwing it into a pencil box  making it look not like a clock in anyway possible with live wires and everything  randomly taking it to English class  setting an alarm on it  and waiting for it to go off with out telling the teacher..... for no reason at all. Delta's were given to those who convinced me that the school/city should answer for the violations of rights in a court room  and they may owe him more than an apology.**

Ok so a few things  if you haven't read an account of the story  not from a news source you should read this part of [the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Mohamed_clock_incident#Clock_and_arrest.)

First off  after another teacher warned him not to take it out  he randomly plugs it in at English class for no reason. Obviously if he didn't let the teacher know that [this not regular looking clock](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/Ahmed_Mohamed_Clock_by_Irving_PD.jpg) was going to go off in class  then it's reason for suspicion. I don't care the race creed or religion  if I'm teaching and hear beeping to find a suitcase with live wires plugged into the wall  I'm going to ask questions and be on edge  especially with all the school shootings going on. 

[This is](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NoM_Cz8GkYM/VfyMsgb-S9I/AAAAAAAAFq0/uUfhs97F_5w/s1600/Clock%2BBomb.jpg) a picture of his clock compared to a suitcase bomb. Most teachers don't know what's what in one  and there is no way that I would be able to distinguish what the fuck that thing was if he didn't tell me it was a clock. 

Also Ahmed seemed purposefully evasive  saying that his other teacher told him not to take it out at school  randomly setting the alarm on it for no reason etc. Like he would have had to know that the teacher would at least question it. 

Now he's world famous for putting together a clock  that most people could do with an instruction manual  and a worse one that I put together at a middle school summer camp. He's gotten offers to colleges  talks from the President  famous people offering him positions  NASA and Microsoft telling him that he's got a spot there if he wants it. Now he and his family are demanding [15 MILLION DOLLARS](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ahmed-mohamed-15-million-dollars-damages_565363fbe4b0258edb3263e0) ?? 

It's like what else do you want? I am the last person to be racist  and I feel  at least my position on the issue  has nothing to do with his race or religion. It's to the point where now  he can literally do no wrong with out the criticizer being labeled racist. I am a huge advocate for equal treatment and am very against racism. I never understood why people are starting to reject political correctness until now.  If it were any other race  then it would not have blown up like this  and if any other race did it then they would not receive sympathy  it would have been handled like a false threat and no news would have broke headlines  no hashtags would have happened on twitter  because people would know that **making a clock with wires hanging out in a weird looking suitcase then randomly setting an alarm in English class is not normal.** 

The family in the letter to sue the city says that it caused emotional and mental distress. Within a week of the incident  most of America was backing the family  he got offers to colleges  conversations with American elites  and job offers that people have worked their entire life for  from making a simple clock that for no particular reason looks very much *not* like a clock.

This is my view. The school was incorrect in saying that it was a bomb  but not racist (I would legit be freaked out and want answers if I were teaching and I heard that thing beeping out of the blue  then saw what it looked like with no explanation -no matter who's it was). He should have been questioned as to what his intentions were. The school  America  as well as colleges and CEO's owe nothing  and should not give anything to Ahmed from this. The city of Irving  Texas owes absolutely nothing to him (especially not $15 million) for doing a job that they were told to do  and called in to do with no previous knowledge of the situation. What are the police suppose to say *""We can't check it out the bomb looking clock because it's racist if we do""* Come on now.

 We do not owe him our sympathy  and the school owes him nothing more than an apology. Apparently I'm closed minded to this. Please change my view.

**edit** Spelling and tl:dr  and also look how someone [replicated his clock](https://youtu.be/9UGLM31S6II?t=1m44s) in about 5 seconds  that doesn't merit all the praise he's getting. Also he's been suspended for pranks before and his sister has been for making REAL bomb threats to the same school. 

**TL:DR: This kid randomly takes the inside out of an alarm clock  puts it in a small suitecase  sets the alarm in English class  and expects the world to cater to him because suspicions were raised.**

CMV: No soldier has defended U.S. freedom since August 15 1945.,"The threat of nuclear attack has kept every other nation from becoming a threat to U.S. freedom  and U.S. foreign policy rather than military action has neutered any potential threat since the end of WW2.

Korea and Vietnam were just to ensure the financial superiority of the U.S. over Russia and were not necessary to prevent any invasion on the home front.

Since the U.S. has maintained its position as the largest military and political power in the world  military technology advances have ensured that the U.S. is unstoppable in any kind of total war situation. 

Russia was the only country with military ability to launch an attack on U.S. soil  but they never did  and since the end of the cold war there are exactly 0 enemies able to sustain such an attack.

The only reason the U.S. maintains such a large military is because nuclear war would annoy our allies. 

TL;DR: The presence of the U.S. military is a war deterrent  but the actual defense of U.S. soil is drawn from the threat of nuclear war.

Edit: This includes cyber security. Marines don't deal with cyber attacks. 

Edit 2: Defining U.S. freedom: the rights and freedoms outlined in the constitution  and interpreted by state and federal law  as long as those laws are considered constitutionally valid  within areas governed by the U.S.

So a soldier volunteering so you don't get drafted isn't defending freedom. The draft is legal according to U.S. law. 

Fighting a proxy war to spread capitalism  isn't defending freedom. 

Fighting in retaliatory conflicts caused by our involvement in those proxy wars is not defending freedom. 

Fighting a war to spread democracy isn't defending U.S. freedom. Spreading freedom is good  but the U.S. shouldn't be the world's maid. 

Defending school integration during the civil rights movement is.

"I believe ""Feminism"" is outdated, and that all people who fight for gender equality should rebrand their movement to ""Equalism"". CMV","First of all  the term ""Equalism"" exists  and already refers to ""Gender equality"" (as well as racial equality  which could be integrated into the movement).

I think that modern feminism has too bad of an image to be taken seriously. The whole ""male-hating agenda"" feminists are a minority  albeit a VERY vocal one  but they bring the entire movement down.

Concerning MRAs  some of what they advocate is true enough : rape accusations totaly destroy a man's reputation ; male victims of domestic violence are blamed because they ""led their wives to violence""  etc.

I think that all the extremists in those movements should be disregarded  but seeing as they only advocate for their issues  they come accross as irrelevant.

CMV: A protest turning violent does not negate the point of the protest,"If a protest turns violent (people being attacked  property destroyed etc) that doesn't ""spoil"" the protest. The protesters can still be in the right for protesting something even if people on their side are being hostile. If people on your side are being violent that doesn't make you wrong all of a sudden. If that were the case almost every political affiliation would be in the wrong. I'm not arguing against peaceful protest  nor am I advocating for riots or violence. I'm just saying that the protesters message matters more than the point their means of getting that message across. For example if an anti-fascist protest happens and a protester punches someone. The protest isn't instantly evil  to claim that it is would be ignoring the whole point of the anti-fascist protest in the first place. 

All I'm saying is if someone does something bad in a protest  that doesn't make the protest bad.

CMV: The US spends too much on the military and that money would be better spent elsewhere.,"The US currently spends $597 billion on the military. Not only is this more money than the next 7 countries combined  but President Trump is asking Congress to further increase this spending by $54 billion. While I understand that the US has built itself up as the protector of the free world  this should be able to be done with significantly less money. Obviously  we could never fully cut military spending but cutting even $200 billion would leave us as the largest military in the world and we could put that $200 billion to better use  such as providing health care  rebuilding infrastructure  or improving education.

Unfortunately  I dont see this ever happening because in the US  any politician who runs on the platform of cutting military spending would come across as un-patriotic and un-American.

CMV: Felons should be allowed to vote.,"So in light of today's [expansion of voting rights to convicted felons who have completed their sentences in Virginia](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/us/governor-terry-mcauliffe-virginia-voting-rights-convicted-felons.html?smid=tw-share) I've been thinking about this a bit more  and I think that there should be no restrictions on voting because of criminal acts  including voting while incarcerated.

I see disenfranchisement of felons as a brute punishment measure which does not serve the purpose of protecting society  rehabilitating criminals  or seeking restoration for victims of crimes.  I think that allowing felons to cast a ballot can indeed promote rehabilitation and reintegration of felons into society by giving them an equal basis of participation in democratic institutions.  It is a small way of saying that society has not in fact given up on them as valued persons with something to contribute.

"CMV: I think all marriages, current and future, heterosexual and homosexual, should be identified by the government as civil unions, and that civil unions should have all the privileges that marriage currently has.","I honestly can't see why this isn't done. Marriage is a religious construct  and we do our best (at least in the US) to separate religion and state. Individuals can get married by their church  but they should be entered into a civil union from the perspective of the government.

The only argument I've heard that I can sympathize with is that this will lead to further expansion of the definition of a civil union  to eventually allow polyamorous groups to gain the rights of a civil union. I personally don't have an issue with this either  but I suppose I can understand why some people may.

CMV: Nationalism/patriotism is primitive and irrational.,"Nationalism and patriotism are both irrational beliefs  that are strongly connected to being proud of something that you had nothing to do with. I live in Sweden that is according to many studies  one of the greatest countries to live in. I had nothing to do with that  so I am nothing but thankful and happy that I live here. I pay taxes and I contribute to the society as much as I can  but I can't personally pick what to do with my tax money. I help elders to receive care  but I also pay for weapon manifacturing and exporting. Being proud of doing the first part would mean that I have to be ashamed that of the last part. That last thing is somewhat correct  but I don't take pride in contributing to society. Doing good isn't something to be proud of to me.

Being proud of something/someone but yourself is just a way to feel connected to that thing or person. Nothing wrong with that as there's no real harm in it  but it remains an irrational feeling to me. Pride isn't something that stretches to other people  like love for example. It's more like happiness or sadness  something that's isolated to yourself.

Please help me understand that intellectual and nice people can be nationalists or patriots. I have yet to meet someone who shares those beliefs who's civilized and humble. Most of them really seem to have a primitive way of thinking and can't really rationalize their thoughts as most of the answers I get when I ask them is ""we gotta stand up for our nation"" and they completely ignore the fact that humans live on this planet together. They want to separate themselves from others so they can feel special  and some of those I've talked to did actually admit that. I am completely open to changing my mind about anything  and this is something that I've been thinking about for a long time and I would finally get to at least understand why these beliefs are sane.

I want to point out that I definitely do not believe that people with these beliefs are stupid. I have just yet to meet someone who's able to explain their views and make me understand why it's the better choice for humanity as a whole.

"CMV: Open borders, free trade and global citizenship should be a key goal of our current society","I see the benefit that the EU has brought to the countries that participate.  I also see how beneficial it is for **me** to be able to move (semi) freely to America  China  Japan  Canada and other countries to establish partnerships.  In my world view it makes perfect sense that open borders  free trade and world citizenship would be a great goal to strive for.  

There are a lot of political parties dedicated to closing borders and stopping free trade.  I understand that this comes from the idea that they want to benefit their nations people but it will only hurt them in the long run.  

I'm interested in broadening my view on this subject.  I certainly understand the concept has flaws but are they not outweighed by the benefits in the long run?

"CMV: As president, Bernie Sanders would not be a good international negotiator/leader, and U.S. interests would suffer","I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics  but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me otherwise (and thus support Bernie)  you'll need to show me I'm wrong about the following points  or that they don't matter:

1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships  thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.

2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent  does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?

3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like ""I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican""

4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally  he just passively let it happen  seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak  but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin  Khamenei  etc.?


Edit: Thanks for all of the info  I haven't 100% changed my mind but I was clearly wrong about a number of things as the links you provided show:

He is willing to use force and can be quite serious and calculating in describing his military policy:

http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/sen-bernie-sanders-2016-campaign-33413797
http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/video-audio/sanders-on-cnns-state-of-the-union

He does have bipartisan congressional achievements:

http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/inside-the-horror-show-that-is-congress-20050825

He does make friends with people who disagree with him:

http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/bernie-sanders-is-a-loud-stubborn-socialist-republicans-like-him-anyway-20150727

which includes this statement from Chuck Schumer: ""He knew when to hold and knew when to fold and  I think  maximized what we could get for veterans "" said Sen. Chuck Schumer  who also participated in the VA talks.

He can be quite assertive in a non-blustery way:

http://youtu.be/WJaW32ZTyKE

And  though it wasn't exactly contradicting my previous view  he does have a better knowledge of foreign policy nuance than I thought:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlmGKKm1Xg

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/the-foreign-minister-of-burlington-vt-120839

Edit 2: No  I am not a Bernie shill  I remain an undecided voter and do not endorse Bernie above other (Democratic  anyway) candidates at the moment. This CMV was about a specific concern I had about the candidate. Sorry my post looks ""too organized""  I guess that's a personality thing.

I believe police officers should have to wear cameras at all times on duty and that all of the footage should be a matter of public record. CMV,"If you possess the right to deprive and individual of life  liberty  or property under the law I think you must then lose the right to privacy when you enforce these actions.  There are too many bad people out there that abuse power for us not to need to be able to check them effectively.  I think in the long run this would be great for police forces  because maybe then people who need police help most  the impoverished  the inner cities  and minorities  would actually be willing to trust them to help.

EDIT- So public matter was perhaps a bad choice of words.  The idea is that the footage is held by a non-interested third party who can be trusted to provide the actual footage to victims/police and their legal representatives  the former of whom can make the footage public if they so choose.  This way the privacy of the victim is protected and the function of police accountability is preserved.

MUCH LATER EDIT- So  I'll address a couple of common objections I haven't responded to yet.

1) Cost.  Yeah  it wouldn't be cheap.  All sorts of numbers are being thrown around and they all have that in common.  Then again though  doing anything on this scale isn't cheap.  And in this case  I think it is **very much** worth the cost.  While my main concern is police accountability  /u/The_Naked_Gun  who at the very least sounds like a real cop  also feels that this would really help the police in defending themselves when they do need to use justifiable force.  In both directions  I think that this could really help improve the relationship of the police with many of the more low income citizens who require their services the most.  If that reduces crime  it starts a whole long chain of events that ends with an improved economic outlook.  Aside from this even  I think its worth the cost on principle alone.

2) Privacy.  There are ways to do this without violating the privacy rights of the victim/agressor here.  As I wrote in my first edit  'public record' is not a good word choice  what I mean by that is the footage should be available to the interested parties  and should be handled by a non-interested party to preserve the integrity of the evidence. No one is going to be made a spectacle by this.

3) Loss of police discretion.  First of all  I am far from convinced on this one.  For this to be the case  you'd have to have someone checking *every single video* trying to catch officers for being nice.  And then what?  Do you think the cops boss is going to fire him for maintaining a productive relationship with the public?  Or that some court of peers would punish a police officer for being kind?  Maybe I'm not as cynical as you guys  but I really doubt that police would feel constrained be inappropriately harsh or strict in that kind of context.

"CMV: The idea that the USA cannot ""afford"" universal socialised medicine makes no sense","Whenever the discussion of socialised healthcare in the US comes up  I always see one central argument against it. It's the idea that Americans  and America as a whole  simply can't afford to pay for such a wide and expansive government programme. That it would place a massive strain on the economy and that overall it would cost too much.

I don't understand where this idea comes from  because from an economic point of view it makes no sense. The US spends approximately 17.2% of its GDP on Healthcare  as compared to less than 10% seen in countries with smaller economies that have socialised universal healthcare coverage. 

I also can't see how it would cost Americans individually more. If all Americans are paying into a single healthcare provider (in the form of tax) then surely the costs for each individual would go down as compared to dealing with dozens of individual health insurance providers. This way the costs would be more easily shared. At the very least  it couldn't possibly cost the individual American more money than insurance or other healthcare provision costs now. 

I'm looking to understand this idea. Is there a genuine reason why people think the US can't afford socialised healthcare? I understand there could be ideological reasons why people object  but I'm looking to understand the economics. Is there a good reason that the US couldn't afford universal healthcare.

For perspective  I'm from the UK  and we have socialised medicine here  in the form of the National Health Service (NHS). This means that aside from a very small number of privately operated hospitals  we can go to any hospital anywhere  and get treatment. This is free at the point of demand  and paid for by the government via taxes and government borrowing.

CMV: The law code should be no more complex than what can be taught to children.,"The reason for this comes down to this simple explanation: **You can't play the game if you don't know the rules.** If you try  the rules become ""do whatever you want  and don't talk to authorities"". By the time you are an adult  you are expected to play the game.

I don't believe it's any coincidence that the countries with the most laws have the [highest per-capita prison population](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/06/prisons/html/nn2page1.stm). In the US  we [literally don't even know *how many*](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/06/06/how-many-federal-laws-are-there-again-n2009184) laws we have. For this reason  a study and book by Harvey Silverglate estimates the average American citizen unknowingly commits about [3 felonies per day](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229).

There are many downsides to a system this complex. 

* It makes *everyone* into yet-uncaught criminals. I think most people try to be good people  but it's not enough to keep you out of prison. In order to stay out of prison  you also have to lie (or at least not talk) about what you do  and you must also perform your actions in concealment.

* It breeds corruption in the population. Why try to follow rules when they are absurdly complex and you don't understand them? Why not break a rule you know about when you've already broken 10 that you don't know about?

* It breeds corruption in law enforcement. If a law enforcement officer wants to put a person in jail  all they have to do is follow them around and wait for them to break a law which the law enforcement officer knows about and the yet-uncaught criminal does not. In theory this allows them to use their power for good (like catching Al Capone on tax evasion). But there are plenty of instances of otherwise innocent people being locked up on technicality.

* It makes law enforcement's job harder. The first thing a lawyer will tell you is don't talk to police. The reason for this is you could accidentally incriminate yourself  even in a failure of articulation. Police require cooperation from the public in order to enforce laws. But an individual puts themselves in great danger by cooperating.

* Laws *must* be selectively enforced. There is no way to enforce them all without even knowing what they are. This creates an entirely separate set of rules all on it's own. i.e. ""I can get away with this because the police don't care about it  I can't get away with that because law enforcement happens to be 'cracking down' on that right now.""

There are many ways we can reduce complexity in the system  and things which I think most people agree on. For one  we can say ""If there is no victim  there is no crime."" Also  ""a perpetrator of a crime cannot be the victim of the same crime""  so a crime against yourself is not a crime. We can also say that all laws have an expiration date. So if you want the law to remain after 7 years (just for example)  then it has to be renewed. This gets rid of many old and unneeded laws. Or we could also just scrap the whole law code and start over ""ten commandments"" style. These are not the limitations or even necessarily the methods themselves which we could use to reduce the number of laws. These just serve as examples.

So  CMV  how is it possible for a person to be a law abiding citizen in such a system? Or how is it not possible to simplify the law code? Or how do the benefits of such a complex system outweigh it's consequences on society? Or how are the consequences I've outlined wrong?

EDIT: My view has changed in one way - Many (but not all) of the profession-specific regulations do not need to be known by people who do not work in that field. There is no great need for an 18 year old to know all the intricacies of medical malpractice  but they should know that they aren't allowed to practice medicine yet and that doctors have rules. I still think many of these regulations can be done away with  but I can certainly see why new adults don't need to know the specifics of them. For this reason I'm going to go through the comments and award deltas to everyone who made a compelling argument about profession-specific regulations (it's a lot of people).

CMV:I believe that organ donation should be opt-out not opt in.,"The way I see it if you're dead or just about so you have no more we for your organs. Why not just give them to someone who has need of them. Obviously there are religious and personal reasons for not wanting to do so but that's why you can say no. With this reasoning it seems to me that organ donation should be standard and give you the option to not be an organ donor rather than ask if you want to opt into the program. 

So that's my reasoning go ahead and CMV if you think otherwise or see holes in my reasoning.

"CMV: Whilst experienced, Hillary Clinton has rarely been on the right side of history, and therefore, is undeserving of the nomination.","EDIT: I do intend to reply to everything  but there is a lot of content and a lot of replies coming quick - give me time!

I'm not a Trump supporter  I just do not like Hillary Clinton.

Whilst there have been times where what she has done could be viewed as admiring (her push for healthcare)  and she does deserve credit for reforming the role of First Lady  I struggle to think of many genuine times where she has been on the right side of history  which  all comes back to the question: Where is her personal conviction? 

Lets take LGBT rights. She jumped on that train pretty late  even for a Democrat. She was firmly against gay marriage  and her recent emails suggest she may still be.

The War on Iraq. Sure  many politicians got this wrong. But Clinton was  IIRC  pretty vocal on this. Only 20 Democrats in the end did vote against the War on Iraq. Whilst clearly a huge mistake in hindsight  we can perhaps forgive this one.

Libya - She has to take part-responsibility for this. We've all the seen the ""we came  we saw  he died"" video. She was the aggressor  and she does need to take responsibility for the lack of forward planning  with  of course  Obama.

Her defense of Wall Street - It is only now  in the last few years  that it has become mainstream to criticise Wall Street. People know that it was Wall Street responsible for 2008 now. Yet  in 2008  Clinton was still blaming home owners and refused to portion any blame on Wall Street.

Honduras - She literally backed a fascist regime.

Supported the death squads in Nicaragua in the 80s

Before the Iraq Nuclear Deal  she was always very aggressive towards Iran.

She supported the continued embargo on Cuba.

She supported No Child Left Behind.

It is on record she was one telling Bill to bomb Bosnia. Resulted in civilian deaths.

Supported the PATRIOT act twice.

Voted for the 2001 Bankruptcy Legislation which would have made it harder for struggling Americans to declare bankruptcy  after expressing her opposition to the bill when she was First Lady.

And then  of course  is the controversies. The obvious ties to Wall Street. The emails. The tactics used against Sanders  and the obvious fact she was colluding with the DNC to get the nomination. 

All this leaves me wondering... when on earth was she correct and on the right side of history?

"CMV: I believe the term ""cisgender"" doesn't need to be adopted by said ""cisgendered"" people. I liken it to diabetics creating a word for non-diabetics other than ""healthy"" or ""normal.""","I love transgendered people  and I find this new (to me) topic interesting.

But I don't think that normally gendered people need to use the term cisgender  or even know what it is. I also don't think it's wrong to refer to a cisgendered person as ""normal "" (edit: regarding their gender identity and not them as a whole person) rather than cisgendered. 

If the trans community want to have terms like this  which I obviously see the utility of  then great  call me that all you want.

I just don't understand why suddenly I am not a normal male  and why it's offensive to refer to myself as a normal <gender>. I don't see why certain transsexual individuals have attacked me for simply refering to cisgender as normal  instead of this ""designated male at birth"" terminology I had never heard of before venturing over to /r/trans. 

I would compare this to anyone with an uncommon trait getting vocally offended by not being refered to by a specific terminology they feel more comfortable with. If autistic children  diabetics  people with parkinson's and paraplegics all wanted to be called something new  it would get incredibly confusing to talk to people without offending anyone.

I completely understand that transsexuals have a hard life  huge suicide rate  etc.  but I don't think that babying them by tiptoeing around words like ""normal"" when they simply are not normally gendered humans is the right approach. I don't believe masking or avoiding reality is ever a good thing  and we can easily push for equal rights and respect for all transsexuals  even if people reserve the word normal when it comes to gender for someone who is cisgendered.

"I believe that it is extremely, extremely, extremely unjust for the media to follow a court case, provide a perspective on it, and show the face of the person on trial. Please somehow CMV.","I could not feel more strongly about this. It is absolutely ridiculous that a person before they are innocent or guilty has their face shown to the public and therefore associated with a crime.
It's completely ridiculous and mind numbingly preposterous to think that a possibly innocent man accused of rape has their face shown  accused of murder has their face shown to ignorant people who take the media on face value.

The person  because of the media spreading their face  is now under threat from the general public. People who may have only seen the first headline and think they did it.

If a man is convicted of rape or murder of a child  then is proven innocent  already their face has been shown to people in that community. The people who don't consider the evidence or respect the outcome  who remain ignorant  now will hold no restraint in thinking it is ""just"" to beat the shit out of him. Because ignorant and easily influenced people want to play ""hero"" and attack the guy they think is bad guy to get some cheap ""look how much of a hero I am"" kicks.

The person whether guilty or innocent is publicly shamed and now prone to attack eg Zimmerman  the ""Dingo ate my baby"" (Azaria Chamberlain) case.
Azaria Chamberlain  when I read a news article about it  was one of the most heart breaking of these. This poor mother lost her child  and was criticised for not showing enough emotion. Because she wasn't ""likeable"" by the general public because she didn't provide them with the expected exaggerated crying and emotion  there was ridiculing of her story by the public and media in Australia which influenced the court case itself.

(If you can  provide me some more examples and I'll make a a list.)

CMV: Realistic graphics in video games are no longer amazing - they're boring now and detract from other possible priorities developers can focus on.,"I'm not inherently against realistic games  but resent their ubiquity as well as the fact that they're the top priority.  I see most of the games in the store  and they just don't speak to me.  I enjoyed Brothers A Tale of Two Sons far more than Red Dead Redemption  The Witcher 3 and Skyrim.

1. Games were invented as an abstract expression.  In the NES days  games weren't literal and drawn to scale.  Mario wasn't literally jumping on turtles.  I appreciate games today wanting to add story and human elements  but all games will ever be (in terms of immersion) is an abstraction with more realistic sprites. 

2. With realistic graphics  there's little room for imagination now that everything is literally represented.  With games like Doom and The Wind Waker  you could fill in plenty of blanks and make lots of assumptions about where you were.  

3. Realistic games have a short shelf life.  In 3 years  people aren't going to care.  Notice how Bioshock 1 still looks great from an artistic perspective to this day  but Call of Duty Modern Warfare (released the same year) looks ugly.

4. Being wow'ed by realistic graphics is a hedonic treadmill.  When a big graphical leap comes  you're at first amazed at how far video games have come.  Shortly after  it's just another game with good graphics.  Why chase a fleeting moment?

5. We've had too many realistic games in the past 10.  When Crysis and Gears of War came out  they looked amazing.  Now every game looks like that.

6. Current gen consoles aren't a big step up  compared to leaps in previous generations.  Even remasters are starting to push the hardware limits.  Going to 1080p today wasn't nearly as significant as the jump to HD in 2005 or the jump to 3D in 1995.  There's only so much you can do with realism this gen.

7. Realistic graphics usually result in (sports aside) games that are violent.  They're ubiquitous.  Ubisoft has made 11 Assassin Creed games but can't make 1 3D Rayman game.  Sony abandoned Jak for more violent titles.  Violent games aren't inherently bad (I enjoyed games like L.A. Noire and The Last of Us)  but don't people get tired of playing the same game over and over?  Don't people get tired of shooting soldiers or beating up zombies all of the time?

8. There are more important priorities.  Story  characters  player reward/motivation systems  depth of mechanics  balance of meta/strategies  unique online/social experiences  user created content sharing and such.

--- 

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses.  I'm going to still keep replying.

I was inspired to make this thread by seeing realistic demos of Zelda such as Ocarina's Temple of Time on the Unreal engine or Nintendo's Wii U tech demo.  And I'm not by principle against realistic Zelda.  I'd love to have one when technology can handle it without costs being crazy.  But just because someone looks amazing in a trailer  doesn't mean the game will be anymore amazing than Ocarina of Time's graphics when we actually play it.  It will be something like.  Wow!!!  Zelda looks real!!! ...Now what?

CMV: Cash advances and high-interest payday loans are unethical and should be outlawed as a predatory lending practice.,"The cash advance business model is to provide a stop-gap product for a consumer in a financial crisis and inhibit their recovery with astronomical interest rates and extremely short lending terms for customer retention purposes. Oftentimes  the [endgame](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/payday-loan-default/) is litigation  wage garnishment  or simply charging-off the loan and selling the debt to a collection agency to turn a neat profit.

When credible institutions canÕt or wonÕt meet a customerÕs lending needs  and that customerÕs lifestyle or livelihood is threatened by an emergency  the cash advance becomes a placeholder for financial instability. Although payday loans are so frequently advertised as _short-term borrowing solutions _ designating the customerÕs allocated earnings as collateral for the loan ensures that they must re-borrow to secure their lifestyle. Inevitably  the cycle of borrowing and repaying becomes unsustainable in the event of job loss or an unexpected expense  leaving three options available: (1) progressively borrow more and pay more in interest  (2) secure a new loan to finance the first  or (3) default on repayment. 

Most customers who do not have to reaffirm their cash advance loans do so with lump sum payouts (bonus money) and income tax returns  however  those with active child support orders and garnishments generally do not have this option available to them. 

Why arenÕt these predatory lenders beleaguered by the same level of federal regulation as banking institutions? Make businesses that provide cash advance services reportable to the OOC and FFIEC under the Community Reinvestment Act. 

CMV - if the marketing goal of a lending institution is retention rather than acquisition  theyÕre doing it wrong and should be accountable. Why are these services legal and largely unregulated?

"CMV: r/changemyview is essentially ""Teach me How to Groupthink"".","First off  this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea.
However  I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth.

Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of 'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind.
I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr  including contradicting ideas  and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as 'stupid' (that'd be the first page of 'hot' at time of posting). This  no doubt  has influenced my view.

I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first.

P.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about /r/changemyview on /r/changemyview as a critique of /r/changemyview.

"CMV: Trump protesters are wasting their time. The more you protest him, the stronger he gets","Recently I've been seeing a lot of stories about protests at trump rallies  including one that had to be shut down due to security concerns. 

While I understand people's dislike of trump (and as someone who really hopes the next president of the US is not someone who's said that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese) I don't see how this could really do significant harm to his prospects of becoming president. 

Any violence or even just perceived threat of violence just makes trump the victim in this scenario. And particularly in trump's case it's not hard to see that one of the big emotional motivators for his support is as a backlash against the perception that the modern left is overbearing and stifling. 

If you dislike trump I'd say the most sensible course of action is to just vote against him  or campaign for his opponent   but I don't see how taking it to the streets does anything except be a fun day out for those who like marching and shouting

"CMV: I believe most, if not all forms of insurance should be run by non-profit organizations and/or the government.","I believe most  if not all forms of insurance should be run by non-profit organizations and/or the government.

First of all  I think the very concept of insurance is inherently that of a public good.ÊÊThe idea behind insurance is that everyone contributes a little bit of money to make one big pool of money  which acts as a safety net to contributors who find themselves in certain emergency situations.ÊÊThis is remarkably similar to the concept of taxation; we all pay taxes so that we can all benefit from public infrastructure  education  the military  etc.ÊNote that I am not arguing that insurance should not be paid for  just that *profit has no place in this arrangement*.ÊÊNormally  the Òinvisible guiding hand of the marketÓ is an efficient way to distribute goods and services amongst a population  but in the case of insurance the imperatives of capitalism actually impede the distribution of services that have already been paid for by the insured.Ê

A for-profit insurance company takes monthly premiums with the intention of holding onto as much of those premiums as possible; when somebody who has consistently paid their premiums finds themselves in an emergency situation  the insurance company will do everything in their power to provide as little Òsafety netÓ as possible.ÊÊOf course  there are regulations and rules that must be followed  and in most cases the insured will eventually get the money they are entitled to.ÊÊBut it is that incentive to impede the process of distribution of goods that have technically already been paid for that makes the whole arrangement inefficient.ÊÊThe amount of time  money  and knowledge required to hold insurance companies accountable is a completely unnecessary waste of resources.

Taking profit out of insurance would have the effect of introducing unimpeded objectivity to the fact-finding and investigations which need to take place when a claim is filed.ÊÊWhen excess premiums donÕt end up lining the pockets of corporate leaders  there is no incentive to use shady methods to withhold distributions.ÊÊNo more contract loopholes  purposefully obfuscated claims procedures  or lengthy legal proceedings to determine liability.ÊÊHypothetically  this latter point could potentially yield huge savings as there is a whole legal industry focused just on litigating competing liability claims between separate insurance companies which are both trying to hold onto their money.ÊÊIf everything was run by a single  government-operated insurance company  competing liability claims could be arbitrated internally and completely objectively  yielding a fair result for a fraction of the cost.Ê

Finally  I want to point out that insurance is unique in its relative importance to our lives.ÊÊInsurance is supposed to be there to help people get through extremely difficult situations  yet it is clear from talking to anyone about their experience dealing with their insurance company that it only adds more stress and confusion to the situation.ÊÊI donÕt consider myself a socialist/communist  and generally I think market capitalism is a great thing  but I also think some things are just too important to be left in Òinvisible handsÓ.ÊThere is precedent for intervention in the market when the stakes are high.ÊÊFor example  we subsidize agriculture because the stability of food prices is of vital importance to peopleÕs lives.ÊShouldnÕt insurance be considered just as important and therefore worthy of our direct intervention and control?ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ

Edit:  just wanted to apologize for not being as active in this thread as I should be  something came up but I will try to throw out some more replies.  

At this point almost all of you have convinced me that I don't understand insurance very well and that the issue is much more complex than I imagined.

CMV: Google Chrome is currently the most overrate browser and it continues to fall further behind,"I been using Google Chrome as far as i remember (probably since 2010) and it's been my default browser on all the computers/laptops I've used. Chrome was fast  reliable and most of all it had a great materials design. 
Having said all that  recently Chromes has failed to live up to its name. Many browsers out there have the same if not better look and feel which also hold up in the speed department. To put it simply  other browsers has closed  if not overtaken the Chrome and everything it stood for.
Saying that you use Chrome means nothing anymore  and might as well use IE (or the incarnation Spartan)   
Edit: Also the memory usage by Chrome is crazy. I can't comment on the memory usage by Firefox haven't used it that much  

Please change my view

Edit 1: I'm off to bed. I'll be back in the morning (Australian morning)   
Edit 2: I do see now that Chrome is still innovating  but not so much on the aesthetics  but rather helping developers and making better websites. Also  after reading most a lot of comments (thank you for that)  I see now that Chrome is more than a browser but rather a platform. It offers a wide range of features (Hangouts  Sync  etc) that no other browser can match at the moment.  
Thank you for your replies  
Edit 3: My intentions were never to show that Chrome or Firefox *insert any browser name* are bad and you shouldn't use them. My intentions were to understand why or why not is Chrome overrated by society (especially on the internet).    
Edit 4: RIP my inbox. Thank you  for the replies  
Also  I am aware that the word overrated is misspelled

I do not think it is sexist or chauvinistic of me to expect my wife to handle the housework as long as I am the only one with a job. CMV,"First of all  let me say that I do not feel that our situation is the way things *should* be. I do not agree that that only men should work and women should stay home and clean stuff. That's not what I'm saying. It just happens to be the case that that is our situation.

Now  the reason I do not feel this is sexist is because its just so fair. Its not about gender. Its not about what men or women should do. Its just about an equal distribution of labor to keep our family going. 

I don't think it is fair that I work 40+ hours a week to provide us with things we need while she sits at home on NetFlix all day (she doesnt do that  just an example of why I feel as I do. That would not be an equal situation).

At the same time  I dont expect her to keep track of hours and make sure she gets in 40+ hours a week of housework  but I hope she can at least vacuum  maybe get some dishes done. Something  at least.

I mean  if she were to go out and get a job  then we would work out a new arrangement. But as long as I'm the only one employed  I dont think its unreasonable for me to not want to come home and have to do dishes or whatever.

Certainly some things are exempt from this reasoning. For example  when we have kids  I'll pitch in regardless  for many  many obvious reasons.

TL;DR - Its not about gender or gender roles. Its just about a fair and equal distribution of labor.

EDIT: To clarify  my wife and I are both happy with our arrangement and she does a fantastic job keeping things clean and organized. I'm not asking because its a contentious issue.

"CMV: A business owner, specifically an artisan, should not be forced to do business with anyone they don't want to do business with.","I am a Democrat. I believe strongly in equality. In light of the Supreme Court case in Colorado concerning a baker who said he would bake a cake for a homosexual couple  but not decorate it  I've found myself in conflict with my political and moral beliefs. 

On one hand  homophobia sucks. Seriously. You're just hurting your own business to support a belief that really is against everything that Jesus taught anyway. Discrimination is illegal  and for good reason. 

On the other hand  baking a cake is absolutely a form of artistic expression. That is not a reach at all. As such  to force that expression is simply unconstitutional. There is no getting around that. If the baker wants to send business elsewhere  it's his or her loss but ultimately his or her right in my eyes and in the eyes of the U.S. constitution. 

I want to side against the baker  but I can't think how he's not protected here. 

EDIT: The case discussed here involves the decoration of the cake  not the baking of it. The argument still stands in light of this. 
EDIT 1.2: Apparently this isn't the case. I've been misinformed. The baker would not bake a cake at all for this couple. Shame. Shame. Shame.

EDIT2: I'm signing off the discussion for the night. Thank you all for contributing! In summary  homophobics suck. At the same time  one must be intellectually honest; when saying that the baker should have his hand forced to make a gay wedding cake or close his business  then he should also have his hand forced when asked to make a nazi cake. There is SCOTUS precedent to side with the couple in this case. At some point  when exercising your own rights impedes on the exercise of another's rights  compromise must be made and  occasionally  enforced by law. There is a definite gray area concerning the couples ""right"" to the baker's service. But I feel better about condemning the baker after carefully considering all views expressed here.

CMV: The recent increase of accusing the opposition of being like Hitler or being a Nazi is emotional blackmail that is insulting to the actual victims of Nazi germany,"There has been a habit nowadays of people claiming that the opposing view is reminiscent of Nazi traits  or that the opposition is basically Hitler. This assertion emotionally blackmails bystanders by forcing them into a position where being in support of that view is synonymous with supporting Nazi-like opinions  regardless of the lack of severity of the views at hand. 

Doing so also belittles the actual history at hand by comparing systematic genocide with comparatively tiny issues. In my opinion  conflating such minuscule problems with such a dark time in history is at a FAR greater degree of evil than any of the views they have been compared with. There are few things as evil and self absorbed as manipulating the emotional responses of your audience in a debate by conflating your opponents views with that of Hitler.

-EDIT-

Many here jumped to the attack of Trump instead of actually arguing against my view  which was that the Hitler comparison has lost credibility and has become insulting emotional blackmail. I don't support Trump therefore going down that road simply worked to move away from the view at hand. 

It was proven however that there are certain circumstances in which comparisons to Hitler and Nazis is in fact valid  and that the increase in using it as emotional blackmail shouldn't detract from the actual value in the comparisons in some debates.

CMV: Allowing a child to be obese should be considered child abuse.,It is common knowledge that fast foods  high amounts of sugar  and fats are terrible for anybody to consume  and parents know this just as well as anybody else. Allowing a child to eat these foods  and then continue to eat the well after the effects of these foods can be seen is awful. Being poor is no excuse for this  as government benefits allow you to decide what you buy for your children  and every day at work I see parents coming in using these SNAP cards to purchase pure junk food. Time is also not an excuse  if you can't make time to properly nurture your kids you should not have them.

CMV:Israel should never have been made,"It seems that Israel has had a massive destabilizing influence on the middle east by igniting racial/religious tensions between the Jewish and Arabic peoples  especially the Arabs who were displaced by Israel forcing them out of their homes. This has Helped lead to the modern expression of fundamentalist Islam and Islamic terrorism against the West  who helped kick Muslims out in favor of immigrant Jews and so are hated. 

The most common defense I hear is that it was 'returning the Jewish homeland ' but no other group seems able to make that claim. The Old Testament/Torah even claims that the Jewish people took it originally from native tribes- why give it to Israel instead of the native tribes if we're trying to 'return it'  and why not give Mexico back to the Aztec or Olmec people? More realistically  why do we care whose ancestors lived in a place a thousand years ago more than we care about the people who lived there within living memory whose families were forced out of their homes  and who continue to be pushed back by Israeli settlements. 

Another argument I hear is that many Jewish people fled to Israel during the Holocaust. This makes sense  but I don't understand why they stayed and were given rule over the land by the UN instead of being allowed/encouraged to return to their previous homes  with some form of restitution for goods or property that couldn't be returned. 

Note that I'm not claiming we should displace the Israelis now  I don't think it would be effective in reducing tension and would only serve to kick more people out of their homes. I just want to understand why some people insist that Israel's founding was good and/or necessary.

CMV: People who can't fit completely within their seat on an airplane flight should be required to purchase two tickets for two seats.,"I just got to a hotel after spending 4 hours on a flight next to a person who was *literally* on top of me for the entire flight. They had to sit with their legs spread apart in order to fit in their seat and their sheer size had them sitting so far forward away from the seat back that their left arm was on top of my right arm the whole flight. The center armrest could not be lowered  as that would have prevented the person from even being able to sit down.(pic: http://i.imgur.com/HuUzvTC.jpg )

It would have to be an objective measurement because simply saying ""this person looks too fat"" wouldn't go over well. And I don't think it would be feasible to go by weight-- a man who is 6'7"" and 220 pounds would fit completely within his seat while a woman who is 5'3"" and the same 220 pounds would be spilling out onto her neighbors. 

The objective measure could be shoulder width from the outside edge of the upper arm to the outside edge of the opposite arm  as well as the same measurement for legs/thighs. The seats themselves have an exact width  and the person's width should be equal to or lesser than that number.

I don't think airlines could get away with a process that required screening at the airport themselves and no way of knowing whether you fit until you arrive (as that could double the cost of your trip or make you unable to fly). I can weigh my bags at home so if I arrive with overweight bags it's completely my fault and something I could have planned for. For the seat situation  people could measure their own widths and compare to the published widths of the airline seats. That way they can plan in advance and buy the 2 tickets if needed and avoid any embarrassment at the airport.

I'm not anti-fat person and I don't judge people in general for their weight. I understand that many obese people have physiological issues  genetic issues  illness  mental illness  etc. It just seems completely unfair for me to pay for a plane ticket and not get what I paid for--which is an entire seat  as opposed to a partial seat because my neighbor required some of my space too. 

Change My View please.

CMV I think unpaid internships are immoral and companies are perpetuating them to reduce the risk of hiring graduates.,"First off  I live in the UK and am mainly interested in the UK laws around internships which can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns). The gist of it is an unpaid intern can either work for a charity (which is fine by me) or shadow a person without doing any work (which is what I have a problem with). Work being defined as anything beneficial to the business. I would also be interested to know how other countries handle unpaid internships. 

Secondly  I am studying computer science and am on a paid internship in London. I earn £23 000 and get a lot of benefits (training  beer  ""simply health care""  a possible job and a pay rise over the summer) and I think this is the way things should be.

I have been reading through some other posts in this subreddit and the only point that came close to changing my view was that during an unpaid internship  the intern cannot benefit the company in any way. This basically means that the company is working as an educator for the employee. There are a few things wrong with this.

1. They will give the sort of training that a entry level employee would receive but the entry level employee would be paid.
2. The employee is not an educator. They have a job to do and so will likely get the intern doing menial tasks so they can get on with their work or breach they rights and get the intern working on something beneficial to the business. I am interested to hear more on this point as I don't understand how you could follow somebody around for a year without doing any actual work.
3. If the internship was purely educational  this is still wrong in my opinion as students are forking out for a university education so they can get a job. They should not have to fork out (in living expenses) for an internship. It seems to me that they have perpetuated that you need an internship (much like what has happened to degrees) to get a job.

Change my view.

EDIT: This kind of blew up so I'm going to try and answer a lot of the common points that have come up.

Point: It's not immoral because it's voluntary. 

Response: I believe that the industry has manufactured a position where it's required to have both a degree and an internship under our belt before they will even consider you for an entry position. While you're not being forced to take the internship like you are forced to vote  you are forced if you want to progress in your chosen career. 

Point: It's mutually beneficial.

Response: I think it's not too much to ask for minimum wage or even a little above seeing as it's skilled labour. A lot of people can't afford to work for free so have to pass on these internships. The only people that can do it are the ones willing to dig further into debt or have rich parents willing to pay their living expenses while they complete the internship.

I think we are much too accepting of women hitting men. CMV,"I'm sure we've all seen a movie or TV show where a woman gets mad at a guy and proceeds to slap him across the face. I find this completely unacceptable. If the gender roles were switched this would be treated as a depiction of abuse but for some reason in this case they are not.

I personally warn the women around me that threaten to hit me unprovoked that if they do I will treat them as equal and hit back. Luckily I don't think I have ever have to carry through because most around me know I will carry it out but the fact that women believe they can hit men with no repercussions is a problem.

Edit: Seeing a lot of posts about how unfair the fight is because men are larger but this does not explain why women are allowed to hit men. If a smaller man hits a bigger man repercussions are expected. Here is a video of a recent commercial showing how accepting we are of women hitting men. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeUqAWDgIAQ

Edit2: Many people took my second paragraph two mean that my view is that men should be able to hit women back. While this could in certain situations be an appropriate response my issue is that where is frequently no response two a woman hitting a man especially if it is in the form of a slap and that this should change.

"CMV: Giving ""smaller state residents"" more voting power is no more justifiable than giving just about any other minority group more voting power","Electoral votes are approximately assigned according to the equation: 

EV = Population/705000 **+ 2**

Some have argued that the **+2** is to give the ""smaller state residents"" minority more representation. But why give extra power to this minority and some some other minority? Racial  ethnic  religious  age-based  etc. Why not give people over 65 5 times more voting power than people under 65?

Favoring the majority is fundamentally what a democratic system is. Minority rights can be defended by human rights. The current electoral system is just trading the risk of ""tyranny of the majority"" for a risk of ""tyranny of the minority"". Which is even worse. CMV.

EDIT: /u/moduspol pointed out that I said ""no more justifiable than giving just about any other minority group more voting power"". This is not true as there are an infinite amount of ways to divide things  most of them completely arbitrary. The state divides are not completely arbitrary. So I was wrong in my original statement.

CMV: I'd rather fight a 100 duck-sized horses,"1. A horse sized duck is quite terrifying. If you've even been attacked by a swan you know the ferocity of a pissed off anatidae. That shit is scary.

2. If we assume the speed of a horse compared to a duck is related to their relative size it'll be easy to briskly walk away from the fight if things go south.

3. It'll be easy to subdue at least a few of the tiny horses and take them home  Breeding miniature horses would be extremely lucrative  just think of all the little girls that could now afford their own tiny pony.

* ~30% Convinced by the argument that potentially killing 100 cute horses is way more emotionally stressful than killing one duck-like abomination. Would have been 60% but I divided by 2 assuming a 50/50 chance of safely capturing them or escaping.

* +~15% Convinced by the argument that fighting 100 targets is potentially more difficult than fighting one. especially if they're relentless and escape is not an option. The omissions of what weapons are available makes it even more difficult.

* +~0.01% convinced by the argument that a horse-sized duck defies biology's code of conduct  It is assumed the duck is fully functional by whatever voodoo witch thought it's a good idea to conjure such a beast.

"We should treat alcohol like sex: don't force teenagers to abstain, but teach them to use it in a safe way. CMV.","I'm Dutch  and here you can drink alcohol when you're sixteen. Next week/year  this age will be raised to eighteen. It's 21 in the US  right?

I don't think this is a good idea. Teenagers who *want* to drink will find a way to acquire alcohol. If they can't do it legally  they will go to an unofficial place and drink the beer an older friend bought in the supermarket. 

Most of us understand that sex education is important  and that it works better than forcing teenagers to abstain. I believe the same applies to alcohol. Sex seems to be even more dangerous than alcohol: you need to drink an excessive amount of alcohol before it causes real immediate problems  but it's easy to get an STD or get pregnant from sex. 

My parents regularly asked me whether I wanted to taste their wine or beer since I was 12 or 13. I started drinking with friends when I was 15 - never more than two glasses in one day. I'm in my 20s now. I've never been drunk  alcohol is not a real temptation or problem to me and I don't drink often.

When you actively prohibit teenagers from drinking alcohol  it becomes a temptation. They want to do what is forbidden. If you treat it like it's very special and not a normal part of life  it becomes special to them as well. This doesn't help anybody. 

So the best approach seems to be to teach teenagers how to drink responsibly. It's just like driving and sex: it can be very dangerous  but it's fun and harmless when you do it 'the right way'. 

**How to change my view**

There are probably many ways to change my view that I'm not aware of  but here are some things I thought of: 

* A link to a source that explains that alcohol is harmful to 16 year olds  even if you only drink small amounts
* Comparisons between nations/states with high and low age restrictions on alcohols and alcohol-related problems.

I believe teaching people to avoid situations that have a higher possibility of rape is not victim blaming. CMV,"I'll start by saying that I think that a rape victim is NEVER even slightly to blame for his/her rape. It is always 100 percent the rapists fault. Anyone should be able to dress how they want  go out and get as drunk as they want  and walk home alone without fear of being assulted  etc.

However  the world that we live in has bad people in it. We tell people not to steal yet we have thiefs. We tell people not to kill but murders exist. People who commit crimes typically know what they are doing is wrong.

I'll give a relevant example. I worked behind the counter at a golf course that just happened to be adjacent to a police station. At least one time every two weeks over the summer I worked there  someone would have the window in their vehicle broken and their computer/suitcase/extra golf bag was stolen. There was one thing in common with every incident: the victim left valuable things in plain sight.

Now  was it ever their fault? No. Absolutely not. After a few break ins  we put out a warning that thiefs were in the area and to hide valuable things out of plain sight. The number of break ins plummeted  and the only people who got hit were people who ignored the warning and left their computer bag in the front seat. It STILL wasn't their fault  but they could have done things to not have been a victim of theft.

This example is not perfect because I'm not advocating for ""covering up"" (like it may sound).  Thiefs will go for easy targets.  For a theif  that means they can look in a window and see a computer  so they break the window.  A rapist may go for an east target.  That has no connection to anything visual.  

I agree with the idea of ""teach people not to rape"". You will never get rid of rapists  though. Male or female. Teaching people how to avoid situations where they have a higher chance of being raped is SMART  not victim blaming. I think there are ways we can improve ""consent education"". There are ways we can improve societal awareness.

"CMV: In the U.S., convicted felons should not lose the right to vote, especially after they've served their sentence.","In many states in the USA  convicted felons lose their right to vote  and the loss of that right is sometimes permanent (i.e. even survives the completion of their sentence).  While significant chunks of the Constitution (e.g. the 14th and 15th amendments) are dedicated to voting rights  I realize there IS a clause in the 14th that allows (but doesn't compel) states to disenfranchise felons.  I can't think of one good reason for states to strip voters of that right  especially considering that the U.S. is among the most punitive countries out there in this regard.  I think this is especially important because of the implicit biases that are created by stripping felons of their voting rights - felon disenfranchisement serves as a proxy for a racial bias in a similar way to voter ID laws.  

So again - my two-in-one CMV is (1) that felons shouldn't lose their right to vote to begin with and (2) that felons who've lost the right to vote should regain it after serving their sentence.  I'm looking forward to having my view changed - thanks all!

CMV: Caitlyn Jenner is a terrible spokeswoman and role model for Trans people,"Cards on the table time  I am an open transgender girl who is currently going through HRT. 

Her media presence is driving me crazy  she is a wealthy woman and has made some disparaging comments about people who receive public assistance. 

She has been a supporter of Trump who actively panders to religious crackpots trying to make a moral panic about a non-issue since they have lost the SSM debate they have picked trans people for their latest ego/money trip. Trans people stuggle to find a job in the USA and they can be simply fired for being trans  she doesn't have a real job at all  just gets wheeled out on the media to represent trans people and make a mess of it. She has no idea what every other trans person in the world is going though 

Then you have the fact that she may have killed someone

CMV: All it would take to destroy our democracy at this point is a successful attack on the scale of 9-11.,"

If this were to happen  Donald Trump would be ""proven right"" and it would give him the ultimate fodder to override judiciary checks on his power.

Americans would buy it...hook  line  sinker.

I believe that an attack of this sort would create a perfect situation for Trump to seize power and erode the checks and balances that are currently in place and have a tenuous hold on the situation.

His recent attacks on the Judiciary have actually increased the chance of a dramatic attack  as it would provide a further catalyst for ISIS as a strategic victory.

If I were a mastermind attempting to create a war between the west and Islam  and destroy America.. this is the golden opportunity!

CMV: Seeing Homosexuality as a core personal identity can be damaging to both individuals and society.,"Ancient Athenians viewed gay sex differently than modern mainstream American culture  seeing it as a simple preference  either for men  women  or both  much like we might view the choice between chocolate or vanilla ice cream. It did not form an identity which separated and stigmatized homosexuals  and I think it is a better cultural practice.

To clarify  I think that emphasizing homosexuality as a key part of someone's identity rather than as a simple matter of taste is damaging in the following way: it pushes someone who is gay to identify with a very specific community (LGBTQIA). This communal identity brings with it a lot of cultural baggage (everything from the stereotype that gay men are effeminate to AIDS concerns) that is unnecessary and often untrue. This view of homosexuality as an identity  the emphasis of ""this is who I am"" rather than ""this is what I prefer"" makes it easier for stereotypes to form. Additionally  an gay person finds him/herself grouped into this bundle of stereotypes even by others homosexuals  who may view behaviors that deviate from ""accepted"" LGBT behavior scandalous and stigmatizing (for example  if the gay person is a Republican). I think the Ancient Athenian view would help to avoid this problem  though of course some stereotypes would persist. 
TL:DR- Viewing sexual preference as a core identity distorts self perception  places people into boxes  and nurtures stereotypes. Note I am not arguing for adopting any other cultural practices of ancient Athens  like the oppression of women. CMV

Edit: I am saying that culture is imposing this identity  not the gay individuals. And that the social cost of either conforming to or defying the expectations of this identity is unnecessary as harmful.",174,0,0,6,13,"[['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexuality_in_ancient_greece'], ['tribalism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201012/in-groups-out-groups-and-the-psychology-crowds),', 'theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/realistic_conflict_theory).'], ['[race](http://global.wisc.edu/multiracial/docs/quintana1998.pdf),', '[gender](http://www1.udel.edu/udaily/2013/sep/infants-faces-091012.html),', '[maksim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maksim_mrvica),', 'effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11762861)', 'evidence](http://www.medicaldaily.com/racism-innate-human-brain-makes-unconscious-decisions-based-ethnicity-240970)', 'changed](http://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy).', 'culture](http://variety.com/2016/tv/ratings/tv-ratings-orange-is-the-new-black-premiere-nielsen-1201805991),'], ['me.](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/05/31/479733094/the-code-switch-podcast-episode-1-can-we-talk-about-whiteness)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/)']]",0,24,0,Yes
"CMV: We should stop calling millionaires and billionaires who regularly give away relatively minuscule proportions of their wealth, ""Generous.""","There's several mitigating factors to rich peoples' ""generosity"" I want to put forth in support of my view:

*  1) Many people are wowed by the amounts of zeros present in the gift and forget that proportionately to the giver's income  the gift may have been piddling.

*  2) Generosity is [defined as](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+generous&rlz=1C1TSNO_enUS564US564&oq=define+generous&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.3732j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) ""showing a readiness to give more of something  as money or time  than is strictly necessary or expected.""  From what I know  I'd say that in richer circles  donating to something and/or someone *is* in fact expected and that you may be perceived badly if you don't donate.

*  3) Giving above a certain amount can serve as cheap advertising for those donating and serves to increase their reputation with the public.

*  4) The tax benefits available for those who donate at large amounts can offset the cost of donating  and I believe even provide an incentive to give in the first place.

*  5) There is a line for each person (that differs I'm sure) that below which they are scraping by and above which they do not need to worry about making ends meat or having small luxuries.  Someone making in excess of 8 figures certainly lives a very comfortable life  even if they can't afford that 2nd private jet they were drooling over.

Lastly  I'll put forth what I think is a better way of deciding whom to call generous and whom to not.  Make it a rule that unless sacrifice of some sort factors into your gift  you are not being generous.  Therefore  if I donate money to an AIDS research foundation and as a direct result cannot buy the new fancier computer I wanted  then I am generous.  If a millionaire donates proportionately the same amount but it forces them to change nothing  then they are not.  The bigger the sacrifice  the more generous the person.  And yes  if a millionaire decides to donate the money they intended to spend on a yacht meaning they don't get a boat or even get a smaller one than what they wanted  I'd consider that a sacrifice and therefore that they were being generous.

I also add that I personally value the gift of time and effort above most monetary gifts because that's something that everyone values about the same.


**EDIT** *I've awarded a delta to /u/gaviidae for [their comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2bag31/cmv_we_should_stop_calling_millionaires_and/cj3e0bt) about judgement and for making me realize that right or wrong  no good would come from employing this view in any practical sense.*

**EDIT 2** *Stepped away for a few hours and this thing got way bigger than I expected so I likely will not be able to reply to every single comment.  That being said  there are some common themes I've seen come up in many of them so I'll attempt to address those here.  I will try to dive back into the comments  but I'm working overnight tonight (EST) and as you may be able to tell from the times I've posted already  have not been able to sleep today. *

*1) I realize I can be tone deaf when communicating sometimes  but I did not mean to imply that not being called generous specifically means you are not doing something good.  You absolutely are and clearly those who have more and give very little of it help finance things more than a collective of persons with meager wealth.  The point I was initially making was that ""generous"" is a very high praise to offer someone and I feel that it can at least sometimes be perceived as a cheap way earning praise for very little.  I'm reminded of [the Biblical story](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+12:41-44) of the woman who gave her last cents in offering and was praised by Jesus as giving more than anyone else.  That's basically the comparison I'm making.*

*2) This view was not in any way meant to comment on how people should receive donations/gifts.  Any gift given freely is worth thanking and worthy of praise from the recipient.*

*3) Nowhere in my view did I state or insinuate that anyone was entitled to anything.  I have several rich friends and don't believe for a second that I'm entitled to any of their money at all.  What rich people feel is their responsibility to give is no one's business but their own.*

CMV: Redditors should boycott buying Gold until Reddit is able to utilize the money they've already collected to improve their servers,"Pretty self explanatory. As some had already mentioned in posts concerning the recent server issues with Reddit  the site has consistently met it's daily Gold goal yet there are still persistent issues with the user experience of the site in large part because of server problems. Until such a time as Reddit is able to correct this issue  we shouldn't continue to buy Gold as a way of demonstrating our frustration with the service. By stopping their source of revenue  I believe  we would be sending a strong message that these server issues can't continue unabated. 

* Edit 1: [The irony](http://imgur.com/FpzJd5j)
* Edit 2: So far the response that really made me change my view was the one offered by u/Destac who informed me that Reddit is actually operating at a loss. However I came across [this](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/10/thanks-for-gold.html)  which tells me a different story. The majority argument that the site is free  that I'm entitled because I'm complaining about a service that is offered for free  I think fails as a valid argument. My counter argument is that just because things are free doesn't mean that they should  for a lack of a better word  suck. There is always room for improvement and my argument for boycotting is that by limiting financial support  Reddit would have to do more with what they already have. This is what many companies have had to do in periods of financial crunch and it often helps improve innovation (I can think of Ford off the bat) In another reddit post on this issue yesterday [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2voi4h/how_i_imagine_most_of_reddit_has_been_feeling/)  the issue isn't about buying more serves but being better able to scale their current infrastructure. 
* Edit 3: Thanks for the gold (I guess?)
* Edit 4: Thanks to u/Amablue who provided a great summary of some of the issues and brought to light some info that was new to me. His post should be the top post and it truly responds to the issue in ways other responses haven't. His tl;dr: 
> Adding more servers won't fix the problem. They're already working on a different solution though  and it's going to take some time. Given that they're already working toward a solution  boycotting them won't help anything. It's not going to make them more aware of the issue or work faster  and it's not going to get the site in good shape any sooner.
* Edit 5: I'll wait for others to weigh on this. It seems that everyone is in disagreement with me but based on the reddit post I submitted above  I'm clearly not the only one having issues with the servers. Does anyone else have suggestions on how to improve the situation besides the one I'm offering?

"CMV: Donald Trump saying that pregnancy is an inconvenience to businesses is not only fine, but true.","Hi Reddit

First let me skip the qualifications about how awful Trump is--I agree much of what he says is awful/untrue  but this is about something I think is overblown.

[This video](https://youtu.be/ESH49gTcaAU) came up in my FB newsfeed and at about the 1:50 mark one person conveys disgust that Trump suggested pregnancy is an inconvenience to businesses. I know this person is not alone in the way they feel. But it seems like Trump is correct. [Here is the clip with him saying it](https://youtu.be/Q6qkJhbA7p0). It seems like one of those things we accept--like sleeping.

I could get so much more done and see so many other things if I didn't have to sleep  but 1/3 of my life is dedicated to it. It is a major inconvenience (I realize others may take issue with this analogy--try to see it for what it is and not get lost in the weeds).

How can a person argue that pregnancy is anything but an inconvenience for a business? Even if someone points to human reproduction as necessary for a society to survive  so what? It being necessary has no bearing on whether or not it's inconvenient to a business--it's closer to the sleep analogy in that case.

You have an employee who will get paid without producing work (assuming the business offers maternity leave--a separate topic). They will then be distracted by obligations to the child--let's be honest  unless you never see your child  working 'round the clock is less likely (work-life balance  etc are all separate issues) and let's assume the person isn't a completely absent parent--most aren't.

So CMV: pregnancy is an inconvenience to a business  and there was nothing wrong with Donald pointing that out.

CMV: The support of Saudi Arabia is one of the worst foreign policy decisions that the US and its allies has ever made.,"The support for Saudi Arabia is boiled down to ideas that Saudis are a critical player in our fight against terrorism and terrorist ideology. Another is the idea that we can only enforce change form the inside.

The Saudis practice a disgusting form of Islam that calls for punishments based on the Quran  the Muslim Holy Book. It is equally as disturbing as the punishments described in the Bible.

The Saudis are also perported to be actual financiers of terrorism. These charges go all the way up to the Saudi royals  although they are unsubstantiated. 

They regularly execute prisoners and political dissidents and treat women like dogs. 

I think it is a moral outrage and antithesis of our values to support a brutal and psychopathic regime such as Saudi Arabia.

One of the questions I have been most interested in recently is whether change from inside a system or outside it is more effective in terms of achieving ones specific goals. For example  is having a popular movement outside a government or having an influence over some of the small number of people crafting policy more effective? To summarise: Top down change  or bottom up change?

I have recently come down on the side of top down  as it seems to me that it is far more efficient to influence a small number of people  and far more effective to have it on the people with the more direct control of change. In light of this  and the news of various people in the American Civil Service and advisory roles resigning in frustration and protest  I have been very much puzzled as to why.

If you have a position with any authority or connection to power  and you want to preserve that which you are charged with  or advance policy  surely it would be better to stay in that position  even if your influence is minimal  as not only is having a little power or influence better than having none once you have left  but  not knowing who could replace you  you risk the position being given to someone either incompetent or wrong headed. If you think that you're qualified for the task  and there is wrong being done within your power structure  then I feel you should stay as long as possible to try and use what power you have to stop it for as long as possible.

Sorry if this seems rambly. Feel free to challenge my initial question or my assumptions about top down influence vs bottom up influence.",126,5,6,7,7,"[['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['stuff""](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1e/d0/9c/1ed09cc3947e041eefac1a2a8f69b3ee--quotes-of-inspiration-photos.jpg)'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart'], ['[\u200b](http://db3paramsstart']]",0,22,1,Yes
CMV: The electoral collage is not a good system for picking the president.,"I have a few reasons for this  so I will number them to make it easy for you to respond.

 1. **It does not represent the popular vote.** It makes sense to me that the president should be who the majority of the people want. The electoral collage can actually prevent someone who has won the popular vote from winning.

 2. **It can discourage voting** I did not get to the poles vote in one of the presidential elections  I am ashamed to admit. However my state did end up going blue  which is who I would have voted for. Now had it gone red  I may have thought that I should have voted  because maybe that could have made a difference. But since it would have been another blue vote thrown on the blue vote pile  I feel like I did not need to vote in that election because it would not have made any difference. I can't be the only person that feels this way.

 3. **It fails to do what it was designed to do.** I have heard the argument that America is more than just the sum of its citizens. Since each state has its own laws  that each state needs to have an equal voice to protect the states specific beliefs. I can understand that view  but the electoral college fails to do this. It seems instead of giving power to the states  it just gives power to New York  California  Ohio and Florida.  It seems like these states decide every election. I don't think I have ever heard someone say ""This election could come down to Wyoming."" So many states are written off for having so few electoral votes assigned to them or because they are already designated as a ""blue state"" or ""red state""

 4. **It is another thing that makes 3 party candidates an impossible choice.** Hypothetical situation  but stay with me. Imagine you live in a ""red state"" But you you don't agree with the republican candidate  or the democrat candidate. So you vote third party. And everyone else that feels that we votes the same way. So the people who tend to vote to make your state red still vote it red  but the third party candidate  actually comes in second. Now imagine that this happens in every red state. And it happens in every blue state. That would mean the third party candidate came in second in every state and received zero electoral votes. Is this unlikely? Of course  but not impossible and to me a huge flaw in this system.

Bonus footnote:   I would seriously love to have my view changed so I could feel better about the upcoming election. I tried my best to keep this as an unbiased discussion of the system  rather than a political discussion. This is why I tried to use the terms ""red"" and ""blue"" as often as I could. I do not want to have a political debate about how they system benefits one side or the other. I just feel that the system of election is broken overall.

**Edit:** I want to reply to everyone but am very behind on the comments so I thought I would just add an edit to explain a few things. It seems I have had many misconceptions about the Electoral Collage.... erm... College. While many of you have corrected some things I had wrong about the system  it has not changed my view that it is a bad system to elect a president. This is why I have not given out any deltas. Hope I am doing this right.

A common theme I am seeing is what the Electoral College is ""suppose to do"" but may not be doing successfully. I am not seeing to much evidence that the electoral college is perfect as is. Again I am really behind on comments  but it seems like the overall conclusion we keep meeting is that at the least  it needs to be fixed in some way.

Lastly  this is my first post here  and it has been an awesome discussion. Thanks to all and special shout out to the fast moving mods. You guys rock.

CMV: Taxpayer funded research should be freely available to any citizen upon first publication.,"edit: Thanks to some discussion with posters and links to recent changes in [NIH policy](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm) and [U.S. policy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/17/half-of-taxpayer-funded-research-will-soon-be-available-to-the-public/) I've conceded that my ""upon first publication point"" may be too dramatic. I think making the published research open access is still important  but have conceded that it should be done after a reasonable time frame. NIH says 1 year  the U.S. government says 6 months.

edit: As /u/Maxzines (and others) pointed out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2lsokk/cmv_taxpayer_funded_research_should_be_freely/clxtd8i) I didn't make it clear that I meant private projects and research done at universities or colleges. Defense departments should be able to do research in secret.

I am speaking purely from an American perspective but I do genuinely feel that this issue should extend to all countries.

My argument is as follows:   
1. Acceptance of funds from any single person or group makes that entity an investor in that research.    
2. An investor in research should have access to the end results of that research.    
3. If a researcher accepts government grants to fund their research then that government  and by extension its citizens  have become an investor and should have free access to the published work.

To clarify I am indeed saying that acceptance of any amount of government funding should lead to free access to the published work  regardless of if it is $1 or $100 000. Change my view  what is wrong about this line of thought?

edit: To further clarify I am talking purely about publication of scientific research. I am in a sense arguing for the legislation of a requirement to publish government funded research in an [open access journal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_journal).

CMV: social conservatives are typically on the wrong side of history.,"In my lifetime  the things that social conservatives fight for are typically issues that 1. Run counter to American values like freedom and liberty for ALL. 2. In retrospect seem like outdated ideas. 

I can understand the argument that without social conservatives in the mix  social progressives would run wild and make changes to fast for most people to adapt. But that still means that their ""purpose"" is to work in the opposite direction of progress towards equality and liberty for all.

Are there examples of socially conservative policies or values that we can look back and all be thankful that they got their way?

*Please note the distinction between social and fiscal conservatives  the latter of which I consider myself. Economics is off the table for this discussion please :)

EDIT: Thanks for all the posts everyone. I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone  but I can summarize the most convincing arguments:
1. Survival Bias: Because social conservatives are typically supporting some status quo  their victories are unnoticed by history  while their defeats are usually praised.
2. Prohibition and Eugenics: Clear cut cases where progressives went against my definition of liberty for all.
3. History isn't done: This one is a bit obvious but I should give it credit. The ""wrong side of history"" is subjective to the moment in time that the claim is made.
BONUS Æ: Shoutout to my girl /u/SwellAsDanielle  for reframing my perspective on the whole Rainbow Cake issue.
