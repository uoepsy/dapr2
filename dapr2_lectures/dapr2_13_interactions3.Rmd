I've just copied the output of the Sem 1 table here and removed the bolding on the last week, so things look consistent with the trailing opacity produced by the course_table.R script otherwise.

# Week's Learning Objectives

1. Interpret interactions between two categorical variables (with dummy coding)
  + Begin with 2x2 (two binary variables)
  + Move on to look at examples with more levels

2. Visualise and probe interactions

3. Be able to read interaction plots

---
#  General definition 

+ When the effects of one predictor on the outcome differ across levels of another predictor

+ Categorical $\times$ categorical interaction:
	+ There is a difference in the differences between groups across levels of a second factor

+ This idea of a difference in differences can be quite tricky to think about
  + So we will start with some visualisation, and then look at two examples

---
# Visualising interactions
+ In our class example we have looked at predicting salary from years of service (a continous variable) and department (a categorical variable)

+ Suppose our company also had two sites, Edinburgh and Dundee, and we wanted to see if the salaries across departments differed depending on location

+ The table below contains hypothetical average salaries in thousands of pounds for each group

```{r,, echo=FALSE}
eg1 <- matrix(c(50,40,30,20),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(eg1) <- c("Edinburgh","Dundee")
rownames(eg1) <- c("Accounts","Manager")
eg1 <- as.table(eg1)
kable(eg1)
```

  department = c("Accounts","Manager","Accounts","Manager"),
  salary = c(50, 30, 40, 20)
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(eg1)
```

+ Let's look at the plot:
  + x-axis shows locations
  + y-axis is our salaries
  + The colours represent departments
  
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6}
dat1 %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = location, y = salary, group = department, colour = department, shape = department)) +

  ylim(c(0,60))

  department = c("Accounts","Manager","Accounts","Manager"),
  salary = c(50, 30, 40, 20)
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(eg1)
```

+ In each plot we look at, think about subtracting the average store managers salary (blue triangle) from the average accounts salary (red circle)

+ For both Edinburgh and Dundee, this difference is £20,000

+ Note, the lines are parallel
  + When the lines are parallel, there is no interaction
  + The effect of one variable (department) does not vary along values or levels of the other variable (location)

Let's imagine our group means look like this instead: 

```{r,, echo=FALSE}
dat2 <- tibble(

  department = c("Accounts","Manager","Accounts","Manager"),
  salary = c(50, 40, 40, 20)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
eg2 <- matrix(c(50,40,40,20),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(eg2) <- c("Edinburgh", "Dundee")
rownames(eg2) <- c("Accounts","Manager")
eg2 <- as.table(eg2)
kable(eg2)
```

+ This time we can see the difference differs
  + £20,000 in Dundee
  + £10,000 in Edinburgh
  
+ Note the lines are no longer parallel
  + Suggests interaction
  + But not crossing (so ordinal interaction)

# Questions?

# Extending past 2x2

+ When fitting an interaction to categorical variables with more than 2 levels, we need additional interaction terms

+ Remember, a categorical variable with 3 levels is represented by the model as 2 binary variables
  + So that means we have two variables to create products with

+ The general rule on the number of interaction terms is:

$$(r-1) \times (c-1)$$

+ Where 
  + $r$ (row) = number of levels of the first categorical variable
  + $c$ (column) = number of levels of the second categorical variable


---
# Example

+ The data comes from a study into patient care in paediatric wards

+ A researcher was interested in whether the subjective well-being of patients differed dependent on the post-operation treatment schedule they were given, and the hospital in which they were staying

+ **Factor 1**: `Treatment` (Levels: TreatA, TreatB, TreatC).
  
+ **Factor 2**: `Hosp` (Levels: Hosp1, Hosp2). 
  
+ Total sample n = 180 (30 patients in each of 6 groups)
  + Between-person design 

+ **Outcome variable**: Subjective well-being (SWB)
  + An average of multiple raters (the patient, a member of their family, and a friend)
  + SWB scores ranged from 0 to 20


---
# The data

```{r, include = FALSE}
hosp_tbl <- read_csv("data/hospital.csv", col_types = "dff")

head(hosp_tbl, 10)

# The group means

  ), col.names = c("", "Hosp1",  "Hosp2"))

Some ways of phrasing our research question:

+ Is there a difference in how subjective wellbeing varies for the three different treatment options between the two hospitals?
+ Does the hospital a patient stays at influence how the type of treatment influences their subjective wellbeing?

# Brief comment: 3-way interactions

+ **In principle** we can extend interactions to more than two variables

+ Consider our salary example:
  + We could ask: Are there location-based differences in how years of service contribute to salary differently across departments? 
  
+ Note that we'd then have three interacting predictors:
  + Years of service (continuous)
  + Department (binary; Store Manager, Accounts)
  + Location (binary; Edinburgh, Dundee)

+ This is a plausible question concerning organisatonal fairness

# Brief comment: 3-way interactions

+ In general, three-way interactions are tricky to interpret

+ Require lots of data to test as the effects are often very small
  + Extends the issues of power already discussed

+ **Only test a three-way interaction if you have strong theoretical reason for doing so**

---
# Summary

+ We have considered how we fit and interpret linear models with categorical interactions

+ We have focused on dummy coded variables (we'll return to effects coding next week)

+ We saw an example of an interaction involving categorical variables with more than two levels (multiple interaction terms)
