# Part 1: Why can't we always use dummy coding?

---
# Why not always use dummy coding?
+ Last week we discussed dummy coding:
  + Dummy coding creates a set of $k$-1 dummy variables (coded `0` or `1`).
  + Each variable's $\beta$ reflects the difference between the group coded `1`, and the reference group (coded `0` across all dummy variables)
  + As such, we say it uses a reference group constraint to estimate our group means

+ This is a neat and (comparatively) straight-forward way to deal with categorical variables.

+ But it doesn't always give us the exact test we need. We might want to compare to:
  + The overall or grand mean
  + Group 1 vs groups 2, 3, 4 combined
  + and on we could go!


---
# Why not always use dummy coding?
+ The link last week has many different examples of coding schemes that answer different questions.

+ This week we will consider the two examples on the previous slide:

  1. Comparing a specific group to the overall mean in your sample (grand mean). This is **sum-to-zero** or **effects coding**
  2. Comparing specific combinations of groups. These are **manual contrasts**

+ Let's start with the grand mean with our class study example.

---
# Effects coding (sum to zero coding)

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
set.seed(1)
gpM <- test_study3 %>%
  group_by(method) %>%
  summarise(
    score = round(mean(score))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    GM = c(rep(mean(score),3))
  )

test_study3 %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=method, y=score, colour = method, shape = method)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 2, alpha = .7) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(test_study3$score), lty = 2, colour = "darkgrey") +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_errorbar(data = gpM, width=0.8,aes(ymax= after_stat(y),ymin= after_stat(y))) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none',
        axis.text=element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = 'bold'))
```
]

.pull-right[

+ To interpret the plot:
  + Coloured points: individual test scores for students in each group
  + Solid coloured lines: group means
  + Dashed grey line: the grand mean (the mean of all the observations)

+ We can see already a key difference from dummy coding
  + Rather than all groups being compared to reading, all will be compared to the grey line.

> **Test your understanding:** If our coefficients reflect the comparison of each group to the grand mean, what direction of coefficients would we expect for each group? 

--

> Where is the biggest absolute difference?

---
# Model with the grand mean
+ If we write our model including the grand mean, we get:

$$y_{ij} = \mu + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij}$$
+ where
  + $y_{ij}$ is the score for a given individual ( $i$ ) in a given group ( $j$ )
  + $\mu$ is the grand mean
  + $\beta_j$ is a group specific effect
  + $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the individual deviation from the group mean
  
+ Let's briefly consider the constraints we apply, before looking at how we do this in R.

---
# Model with the grand mean
+ This means that each group mean is:

$$\mu_{read} = \mu + \beta_{read}$$

$$\mu_{self-test} = \mu + \beta_{self-test}$$

$$\mu_{summarise} = \mu + \beta_{summarise}$$

+ And as with dummy coding, this means we have 4 things to estimate ( $\mu$ , $\beta_{read}$ , $\beta_{self-test}$ , $\beta_{summarise}$ ), but only 3 group means.

---
# Sum to zero constraint

+ In sum to zero coding, we fix this with the following constraint:

$$\sum_{j=1}^m \beta_j = 0$$

+ Or alternatively written for the 3 group case:

$$\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 = 0$$


---
# Sum to zero constraint
+ This constraints leads to the following interpretations:

+ $\beta_0$ is the grand mean (mean of all observations) or $\mu$

+ $\beta_j$ are the differences between the coded group and the grand mean:

$$\beta_j = \mu_j - \mu$$

---
# Why the grand mean?

$$\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 = 0$$

+ Substitute $\beta_0$ :

$$(\mu_1 - \beta_0) + (\mu_2 - \beta_0) + (\mu_3 - \beta_0) = 0$$

$$\mu_1 + \mu_2 + \mu_3 = 3\beta_0$$

$$\beta_0 = \frac{\mu_1 + \mu_2 + \mu_3}{3} $$
$$\beta_0 = \mu$$

---
# Sum to zero constraint

+ Finally, we can get back to our group means from the coefficients as follows: 

$$\mu_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$

$$\mu_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_2$$

$$\mu_3 = \beta_0 - (\beta_1 + \beta_2)$$

# The wide world of contrasts 
+ We have now seen two examples of coding schemes (dummy and effect).

+ There are **lots** of different coding schemes we can use for categorical variables to make different comparisons.
  + If you are interested, see the excellent resource on [UCLA website](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/)

+ But always remember...

**The data is the same, the tested contrast differs**

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Part 3: The data doesn't change, what we compare does

---
# The data is the same, the tested contrasts differ

+ We can run our model for `method` using both dummy and sum-to-zero coding schemes

```{r}
contrasts(test_study3$method) <- contr.treatment
m_dummy <- lm(score ~ method, data = test_study3)

# Change the contrasts and run again
contrasts(test_study3$method) <- contr.sum
m_zero <- lm(score ~ method, data = test_study3)

```

+ We see that the model coefficients are different, because the tested contrast differs:

.pull-left[
```{r}
coef(m_dummy)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
coef(m_zero)
```
]

---
# The data is the same, the tested contrasts differ

However, if we create a small data set,

```{r}
treat <- tibble(method = c("read", "self-test", "summarise"))
```

and add the predicted values from our models,

```{r}
treat %>%
  mutate(
    pred_dummy = predict(m_dummy, newdata = .),
    pred_zero = predict(m_zero, newdata = .)
  )
```

You can see that no matter what coding or contrasts we use, we are still modelling the group means!

# Part 4: Setting up our own specific tests


---
# Why do we need manual contrasts?
+ We have looked now at dummy and sum-to-zero coding. 

+ These provide us with coefficients which test the significance of the difference between means of groups and some other mean (either reference group or grandmean)
  + The other coding schemes we linked to do exactly the same thing.

+ ***Sometimes*** we have a research question that requires the test of the difference between particular combinations of groups for which there is no *"off the shelf"* test. 

+ For such situations, we can apply a set of rules and test what are referred to as manual contrasts.


---
# Manual contrast testing
+ We can structure a wide variety of contrasts so long as they can be written:

  1. As a linear combination of population means.
  2. The associated coefficients (weights $c_1$ etc below) sum to zero.

+ So

$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 $$
+ Mathematically, we represent this contrast as

$$c_1\mu_1 + c_2\mu_2 + c_3\mu_3 $$

+ With

$$c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0$$

---
# New example
+ Suppose we were interested in the effect of various relationship statuses on an individuals subjective well-being (`swb`)

+ Our predictor is `status` which has 5 levels:
  + Married or Civil Partnership
  + Cohabiting relationship
  + Single
  + Widowed
  + Divorced

+ Let's say we have data on 500 people.

---
# Data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
n <- round(500*(c(.55, .2, .1, .05, .1)),0)
set.seed(7284)
wb_tib <- tibble(
  swb = c(rnorm(n[1], 11, 3.6),
          rnorm(n[2], 12, 4.2),
          rnorm(n[3], 8, 2.2),
          rnorm(n[4], 6, 1.1),
          rnorm(n[5], 9.5, 2.5)),
  status = factor(c(rep("Married/CP", n[1]),
             rep("Cohab", n[2]),
             rep("Single", n[3]),
             rep("Widowed", n[4]),
             rep("Divorced", n[5]))
             )
)

wb_tib %>%
  group_by(status) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean = round(mean(swb),2),
    sd = round(sd(swb),2)
  ) %>%
  kable(.)%>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```

# Our questions
+ Suppose we want to know if there are `swb` differences between:

1. Those who are currently or previously married or in a civil partnership vs not.
    + Group 1: `Married/CP`, `Divorced`, `Widowed`
    + Group 2: `Single`, `Cohab`

2. Those who are currently married or in a civil partnership vs those who have previously been.
    + Group 1: `Married/CP`
    + Group 2: `Divorced`, `Widowed`

--

+ To test this, we need to:
  + group levels of our factor `status`
  + calculate a mean of these new sub-groups making sure all levels contribute equally to their respective groups
  + then test the difference between these means

+ Manual contrasts can do this for us, if we follow some rules.

---
# Rules for manual contrasts

+ **Rule 1**: Weights (e.g. $c_1$ etc from previous slide) range between -1 and 1

+ **Rule 2**: The group(s) in one chunk are given negative weights, the group(s) in the other get positive weights

+ **Rule 3**: The sum of the weights of the comparison must be 0

+ **Rule 4**: If a group is not involved in the comparison, weight is 0

+ **Rule 5**: For a given comparison, weights assigned to group(s) are equal to 1 divided by the number of groups in that chunk.

+ **Rule 6**: Restrict yourself to running $k$ - 1 comparisons (where $k$ = number of groups)

+ **Rule 7**: Each contrast can only compare 2 chunks

+ **Rule 8**: Once a group is singled out, it can not enter other contrasts

# Orthogonal vs. Non-orthogonal Contrasts
+ Orthogonal contrasts test independent sources of variation.
  + If we follow the rules above, we will have orthogonal contrasts.

+ Non-orthogonal contrasts test non-independent sources of variation.
  + This presents some further statistical challenges in terms of making inferences. 
  + We will come back to this discussion later in the course.

---
# Checking if contrasts are orthogonal
+ The sum of the products of the weights will = 0 for any pair of orthogonal comparisons

$$\sum{c_{1j}c_{2j}} = 0$$

# Part 5: Testing manual contrasts using emmeans


---
# Using `emmeans` to test contrasts

+ We will use the package `emmeans` to test our contrasts
  + We will also be using this in the next few weeks to look at analysing experimental designs.

+ **E**stimated
+ **M**arginal
+ **Means**

+ Essentially this package provides us with a lot of tools to help us model contrasts and linear functions.

---
# Working with `emmeans`
+ First we run our model:

```{r}
status_res <- lm(swb ~ status, wb_tib)
```

+ Next we use the `emmeans` to get the estimated means of our groups.

```{r}

status_mean <- emmeans(status_res, ~status)
status_mean
```


---
# Visualise estimated means

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(status_mean)
```

+ We then use these means to test contrasts

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(status_mean)
```

]

---
# Defining the contrast

+ **KEY POINT**: The order of your categorical variable matters as `emmeans` uses this order. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
contrasts %>% 
  kable(.) %>%
  kable_styling(., full_width = F)
```


```{r}
levels(wb_tib$status)
```

```{r}
status_comp <- list("Married or CP vs not" = c(-1/2, 1/3, 1/3, -1/2, 1/3),
                    "Current vs Not current" = c(0, -1/2, 1, 0, -1/2))

```


---
# Requesting the test
+ In order to test our effects, we use the `contrast` function from `emmeans`

```{r}
status_comp_test <- contrast(status_mean, status_comp)
status_comp_test
```
+ We can see we have p-values, but we can also request confidence intervals

```{r}
confint(status_comp_test)
```


---
# Interpreting the results
+ The estimate is the difference between the average of the group means within each chunk.


```{r}
confint(status_comp_test)
```
+ So for `Married or CP vs not` :

```{r}
((10.63 + 6.00 + 9.37)/3) - ((11.44 + 8.06)/2)
```
+ So those who are not currently or previously married or in a civial partnership have higher SWB.
  + And this is significant.

# Questions?

---
# Summary of today

+ We have considered different ways in which we can code categorical predictors.

+ Take home:
  + Use of coding schemes allows us to compare groups (or levels) in lots of ways.
  + Our $\beta$'s will represent differences in group means.
  + The scheme we use determines which group or combination of groups we are comparing.
  + **In all cases the underlying data is unchanged.**

+ We also looked at the use of `emmeans` in testing manual contrasts.
  + Run the model
  + Estimate the means
  + Define the contrast
  + Test the contrast

+ Though I am sure tricky at points, I hope this shows how coding schemes are a very flexible tool for testing hypotheses.
