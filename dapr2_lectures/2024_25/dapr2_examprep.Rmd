# Exam Strategy: Section A

.pull-left[

**Section A - 30 marks**

+ 15 MCQs  

+ 2 marks per MCQ  

+ On all topics   

+ Similar style to weekly quizzes - all questions have 4 proposed answers to choose from
]

.pull-right[

**Suggested Approach**
+ Similar to quiz questions on Learn  
+ Spend 15-30 minutes on MCQs:
  + Approx. 1-2 minutes per MCQ
  + You can answer these quickly at the end
  + Do the ones you know, then move on
  + Keep track of how many you have not done, so you can go back to them at the end

# Exam Strategy: Section B


.pull-left[
**Section B - 70 marks**  

+ 10 Questions, where marks range from 4 to 12 marks per question:
   + 2 x 4 marks
   + 2 x 5 marks
   + 2 x 6 marks
   + 2 x 8 marks
   + 2 x 12 marks

+ On range of topics, where some questions will involve:
    + Short calculations
    + Asking you to explain statistical concepts discussed in the course
    + Giving you a research design/question and task you with detailing an appropriate analysis plan
    + Giving you model output and ask you to provide interpretation  
]
.pull-right[

**Suggested Approach** 

+ 70% of marks in this section
+ Spend more time on higher mark questions
    + Marks arranged from highest to lowest marks (i.e., Q1 = 12 marks, Q10 = 4 marks)
+ Skim read all 10 questions
    + Prioritise highest mark questions
    + **BUT** also do the ones you know first

# General Tips for Approaching Exam

+ Split your time according to the marks for the sections and questions  
  
+ Make an attempt to answer all questions
    + Section A: Guess if you need to - don't leave an MCQ answer blank 
    + Section B: A brief answer is better than no answer  
     
+ Section B: Read the questions very carefully. For the longer questions, the question will include information on the things we expect your answers to comment on. Questions in Section B have the number of marks indicated next to each question.
    + As a **(very rough)** rule of thumb, a mark will typically correspond to a sentence (so for a 4-mark question a 4-5 sentence answer would likely be appropriate)  
    
+ You will not necessarily need to directly use all the equations on the equation sheet, but they may help you answer questions
