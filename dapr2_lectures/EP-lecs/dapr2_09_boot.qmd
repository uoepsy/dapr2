**What is bootstrapping?**

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- An alternative way of estimating the variability of a coefficient estimate (i.e., the standard error and confidence interval).
- Unlike regular linear models, bootstrapping doesn't require that errors be normally distributed or equal across the range of the predictor.

::: {.dapr2callout}
**How does bootstrapping work?**

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- It is based on repeatedly resampling from a given sample and then computing summary statistics on those samples.
- By combining those summary values, we get a sampling distribution: an approximation of how that statistic is distributed in the population.
- (*Why* exactly bootstrapping works is pretty mysterious unless you have a strong maths background. Trust me that it works!)

## Revisiting this week's learning objectives

<br>

::: {}
::: {.dapr2callout}
**When would we bootstrap a linear model's estimates?**

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- When a linear model's residuals don't fulfil the model's assumptions about normality of errors and equal variance of errors.
- Those assumptions are what makes the formulae for estimating standard error and confidence intervals work.
- When those assumptions aren't met, then we need a different way of estimating standard error and CIs: bootstrapping.
