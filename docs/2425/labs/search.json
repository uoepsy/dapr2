Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nTo visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing and social interactions, density plots were used. To understand the strength of association between the two variables, the correlation coefficient was estimated. To investigate whether the number of weekly social interactions influences wellbeing (WEMWBS) scores, the following simple linear regression model was used:\n\\[\n\\text{Wellbeing} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Social Interactions}\n\\] From Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can see that both wellbeing \\((M = 36.3, SD = 5.39)\\) and social interactions \\((M = 12.06, SD = 4.02)\\) followed unimodal distributions. There was a weak, positive, linear association between WEMWBS scores and the weekly number of social interactions for the participants in the sample \\((r = .24)\\).\nFull regression results are displayed in Table 3. There was a significant association between wellbeing scores and social interactions \\((\\beta = 0.32, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001)\\). The estimated wellbeing score with no social interactions per week was 32.41. Each additional social interaction was associated with a 0.32 point increase in wellbeing scores."

    "text": "Model Fitting & Interpretation\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nRecall the model specified in Q1, and:\n\nState the parameters of the model. How do we denote parameter estimates?\n\nFit the linear model in using lm(), assigning the output to an object called mdl1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we did for simple linear regression, we can fit our multiple regression model using the lm() function. For a recap, see the statistical models flashcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nA model for the association between \\(x_1\\) = weekly numbers of social interactions, \\(x_2\\) = weekly outdoor time, and \\(y\\) = scores on the WEMWBS can be given by: \\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon \\\\ \\quad \\\\\n\\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\nIn the model specified above,\n\n\n\\(\\mu_{y|x_1, x_2} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\\) represents the systematic part of the model giving the mean of \\(y\\) at each combination of values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\);\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) represents the error (deviation) from that mean, and the errors are independent from one another.\n\nThe parameters of our model are:\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) (The intercept);\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_1\\));\n\n\\(\\beta_2\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_2\\));\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) (The standard deviation of the errors).\n\nWhen we estimate these parameters from the available data, we have a fitted model (recall that the h\\(\\hat{\\textrm{a}}\\)ts are used to distinguish our estimates from the true unknown parameters):\n\\[\n\\widehat{Wellbeing} = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\hat \\beta_2 \\cdot Outdoor~Time\n\\] And we have residuals \\(\\hat \\epsilon = y - \\hat y\\) which are the deviations from the observed values and our model-predicted responses.\nFitting the model in R:\n\nmdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Visual Explanation\nNote that for simple linear regression we talked about our model as a line in 2 dimensions: the systematic part \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) defined a line for \\(\\mu_y\\) across the possible values of \\(x\\), with \\(\\epsilon\\) as the random deviations from that line. But in multiple regression we have more than two variables making up our model.\nIn this particular case of three variables (one outcome + two explanatory), we can think of our model as a regression surface (see Figure 3). The systematic part of our model defines the surface across a range of possible values of both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Deviations from the surface are determined by the random error component, \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Regression surface for wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, from two different angles\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about trying to figure out how to visualise it if we had any more explanatory variables! We can only concieve of 3 spatial dimensions. One could imagine this surface changing over time, which would bring in a 4th dimension, but beyond that, it’s not worth trying!\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nUsing any of:\n\nmdl1\nmdl1$coefficients\ncoef(mdl1)\ncoefficients(mdl1)\nsummary(mdl1)\n\nWrite out the estimated parameter values of:\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_0\\), the estimated average wellbeing score associated with zero hours of outdoor time and zero social interactions per week.\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_1\\), the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with an additional social interaction per week (an increase of one), holding weekly outdoor time constant.\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_2\\), the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with one hour increase in weekly outdoor time, holding the number of social interactions constant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTo interpret and extract information, see the simple & multiple regression models - extracing information flashcards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nmdl1$coefficients\ncoef(mdl1)\ncoefficients(mdl1)\nsummary(mdl1)\n\n\n\n\nmdl1$coefficients\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\n\ncoef(mdl1)\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\n\ncoefficients(mdl1)\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\nLook under the “Estimate” column:\n\nsummary(mdl1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-15.7611  -3.1308  -0.4213   3.3126  18.8406 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

How do we denote parameter estimates?\n\nFit the linear model in using lm(), assigning the output to an object called mdl1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we did for simple linear regression, we can fit our multiple regression model using the lm() function. For a recap, see the statistical models flashcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nA model for the association between \\(x_1\\) = weekly numbers of social interactions, \\(x_2\\) = weekly outdoor time, and \\(y\\) = scores on the WEMWBS can be given by: \\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon \\\\ \\quad \\\\\n\\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\nIn the model specified above,\n\n\n\\(\\mu_{y|x_1, x_2} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\\) represents the systematic part of the model giving the mean of \\(y\\) at each combination of values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\);\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) represents the error (deviation) from that mean, and the errors are independent from one another.\n\nThe parameters of our model are:\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) (The intercept);\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_1\\));\n\n\\(\\beta_2\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_2\\));\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) (The standard deviation of the errors).\n\nWhen we estimate these parameters from the available data, we have a fitted model (recall that the h\\(\\hat{\\textrm{a}}\\)ts are used to distinguish our estimates from the true unknown parameters):\n\\[\n\\widehat{Wellbeing} = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\hat \\beta_2 \\cdot Outdoor~Time\n\\] And we have residuals \\(\\hat \\epsilon = y - \\hat y\\) which are the deviations from the observed values and our model-predicted responses.\nFitting the model in R:\n\nmdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Visual Explanation\nNote that for simple linear regression we talked about our model as a line in 2 dimensions: the systematic part \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) defined a line for \\(\\mu_y\\) across the possible values of \\(x\\), with \\(\\epsilon\\) as the random deviations from that line. But in multiple regression we have more than two variables making up our model.\nIn this particular case of three variables (one outcome + two explanatory), we can think of our model as a regression surface (see Figure 3). The systematic part of our model defines the surface across a range of possible values of both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Deviations from the surface are determined by the random error component, \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Regression surface for wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, from two different angles\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about trying to figure out how to visualise it if we had any more explanatory variables! We can only concieve of 3 spatial dimensions. One could imagine this surface changing over time, which would bring in a 4th dimension, but beyond that, it’s not worth trying!\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nUsing any of:\n\nmdl1\nmdl1$coefficients\ncoef(mdl1)\ncoefficients(mdl1)\nsummary(mdl1)\n\nWrite out the estimated parameter values of:\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_0\\), the estimated average wellbeing score associated with zero hours of outdoor time and zero social interactions per week.\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_1\\), the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with an additional social interaction per week (an increase of one), holding weekly outdoor time constant.\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_2\\), the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with one hour increase in weekly outdoor time, holding the number of social interactions constant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTo interpret and extract information, see the simple & multiple regression models - extracing information flashcards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nmdl1$coefficients\ncoef(mdl1)\ncoefficients(mdl1)\nsummary(mdl1)\n\n\n\n\nmdl1$coefficients\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\n\ncoef(mdl1)\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\n\ncoefficients(mdl1)\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\nLook under the “Estimate” column:\n\nsummary(mdl1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-15.7611  -3.1308  -0.4213   3.3126  18.8406 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Don’t forget you can look up the documentation by typing ?plot_model in the console.\nSince using plot_model(), We need to use ‘mdl_z’ here not ‘mdl_s’ - it won’t work with a model that’s used the scale() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nSemi-partial (part) correlation coefficient\nVisualisation\n\n\n\nFirst, lets recall the estimates from our standardized model (rounding to 2 decimal places):\n\nround(mdl_z$coefficients, 2)\n\n   (Intercept)   z_social_int z_outdoor_time \n          0.00           0.25           0.26 \n\n\nNext, lets calculate the semi-partial correlation coefficients:\n\n#semi-partial (part) correlation between wellbeing & social interactions\nwb_soc &lt;- spcor.test(mwdata$wellbeing, mwdata$social_int, mwdata$outdoor_time,  method=\"pearson\")\n#round correlation coefficient estimate to 2 decimal places\nround(wb_soc$estimate, 2)\n\n[1] 0.25\n\n#semi-partial (part) correlation between wellbeing & outdoor time\nwb_out &lt;- spcor.test(mwdata$wellbeing, mwdata$outdoor_time, mwdata$social_int, method=\"pearson\")\n#round correlation coefficient estimate to 2 decimal places\nround(wb_out$estimate, 2)\n\n[1] 0.26\n\n\nWe can see that the slope estimates from the standardized model are equivalent to the semi-partial (part) correlation coefficients. This makes theoretical sense given that:\nIn our example, we had a multiple regression model with two predictors, so in our case this means that the \\(\\beta^*\\) coefficients quantify the change in the dependent variable when one predictor (i.e., outdoor time) changes by one standard deviation while the other predictor remains constant (i.e., number of weekly social interactions); whilst the semi-partial correlation for a given predictor (i.e., outdoor time) represents the correlation between the dependent variable and that predictor (i.e., wellbeing and outdoor time) while controlling for the other predictor (i.e., number of weekly social interactions). Thus, the standardized estimate (i.e., \\(\\beta^*\\) coefficient) for one predictor in a multiple regression model with two predictors is equivalent to the semi-partial correlation coefficient for that predictor because, in this context, “holding all other predictors constant” refers to the one remaining predictor.\nNote\nIf this seems a bit confusing, try not to worry - it was more a demonstration of the relationship between \\(r\\) and \\(\\beta^*\\) for when you have 2 predictors (since you saw how this worked with 1 predictor in lecture, we thought it would be useful to extend to 2 predictors). Also, this can become pretty messy very quickly when you have a model with 3+ predictors as the associations among variables becomes more complex.\n\n\n\nplot_model(mdl_z, type = \"eff\",\n           terms = c(\"z_outdoor_time\"), \n           show.data = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nPlot the data and the fitted regression line from both the unstandardized and standardized models. To do so, for each model:\n\nExtract the estimated regression coefficients e.g., via betas &lt;- coef(mdl)\n\nExtract the first entry of betas (i.e., the intercept) via betas[1]\n\nExtract the second entry of betas (i.e., the slope) via betas[2]\n\nProvide the intercept and slope to the function\n\nNote down what you observe from the plots - what is the same / different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is very similar to Lab 1 Q7.\nExtracting values\nThe function coef() returns a vector (a sequence of numbers all of the same type). To get the first element of the sequence you append [1], and [2] for the second.\nPlotting\nIn your ggplot(), you will need to specify geom_abline(). This might help get you started:\n\n geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope) \n\n\nYou may also want to plot these side by side to more easily compare, so consider using | from patchwork. For further ggplot() guidance, see the how to visualise data flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nFirst extract the values required for both non-standardized and standardized models:\n\n#non-standardized (from 'mdl')\nbetas &lt;- coef(mdl)\nintercept &lt;- betas[1]\nslope &lt;- betas[2]\n\n#standardized (from 'mdl_z')\nbetas_z &lt;- coef(mdl_z)\nintercept_z &lt;- betas_z[1]\nslope_z &lt;- betas_z[2]\n\nWe can plot the models as follows:\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope, color = 'blue') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = z_social_int, y = z_wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept_z, slope = slope_z, color = 'red') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week; Z-Scored)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores; Z-Scored\")\n\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities\n\nThe data points are distributed in the same pattern\n\nThe slope of the line follows the same gradient\n\nDifferences\n\nThe x- and y-axis scales are different for each plot. This is because:\n\nThe unstandardized is in the original units where we interpret the slope as the change in \\(y\\) units for a unit change in \\(x\\)\n\nThe standardized is in SD units where we interpret the slope as the SD change in \\(y\\) for 1 SD change in \\(x\\)"

As presented in Table 1, outdoor time was significantly associated with wellbeing scores \\((\\beta = 0.26, SE = 0.07, p &lt; .001)\\) after controlling for the number of weekly social interactions.

Don’t forget you can look up the documentation by typing ?plot_model in the console.\nSince using plot_model(), We need to use ‘mdl_z’ here not ‘mdl_s’ - it won’t work with a model that’s used the scale() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nSemi-partial (part) correlation coefficient\nVisualisation\n\n\n\nFirst, lets recall the estimates from our standardized model (rounding to 2 decimal places):\n\nround(mdl_z$coefficients, 2)\n\n   (Intercept)   z_social_int z_outdoor_time \n          0.00           0.25           0.26 \n\n\nNext, lets calculate the semi-partial correlation coefficients:\n\n#semi-partial (part) correlation between wellbeing & social interactions\nwb_soc &lt;- spcor.test(mwdata$wellbeing, mwdata$social_int, mwdata$outdoor_time,  method=\"pearson\")\n#round correlation coefficient estimate to 2 decimal places\nround(wb_soc$estimate, 2)\n\n[1] 0.25\n\n#semi-partial (part) correlation between wellbeing & outdoor time\nwb_out &lt;- spcor.test(mwdata$wellbeing, mwdata$outdoor_time, mwdata$social_int, method=\"pearson\")\n#round correlation coefficient estimate to 2 decimal places\nround(wb_out$estimate, 2)\n\n[1] 0.26\n\n\nWe can see that the slope estimates from the standardized model are equivalent to the semi-partial (part) correlation coefficients. This makes theoretical sense given that:\nIn our example, we had a multiple regression model with two predictors, so in our case this means that the \\(\\beta^*\\) coefficients quantify the change in the dependent variable when one predictor (i.e., outdoor time) changes by one standard deviation while the other predictor remains constant (i.e., number of weekly social interactions); whilst the semi-partial correlation for a given predictor (i.e., outdoor time) represents the correlation between the dependent variable and that predictor (i.e., wellbeing and outdoor time) while controlling for the other predictor (i.e., number of weekly social interactions). Thus, the standardized estimate (i.e., \\(\\beta^*\\) coefficient) for one predictor in a multiple regression model with two predictors is equivalent to the semi-partial correlation coefficient for that predictor because, in this context, “holding all other predictors constant” refers to the one remaining predictor.\nNote\nIf this seems a bit confusing, try not to worry - it was more a demonstration of the relationship between \\(r\\) and \\(\\beta^*\\) for when you have 2 predictors (since you saw how this worked with 1 predictor in lecture, we thought it would be useful to extend to 2 predictors). Also, this can become pretty messy very quickly when you have a model with 3+ predictors as the associations among variables becomes more complex.\n\n\n\nplot_model(mdl_z, type = \"eff\",\n           terms = c(\"z_outdoor_time\"), \n           show.data = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nPlot the data and the fitted regression line from both the unstandardized and standardized models. To do so, for each model:\n\nExtract the estimated regression coefficients e.g., via betas &lt;- coef(mdl)\n\nExtract the first entry of betas (i.e., the intercept) via betas[1]\n\nExtract the second entry of betas (i.e., the slope) via betas[2]\n\nProvide the intercept and slope to the function\n\nNote down what you observe from the plots - what is the same / different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is very similar to Lab 1 Q7.\nExtracting values\nThe function coef() returns a vector (a sequence of numbers all of the same type). To get the first element of the sequence you append [1], and [2] for the second.\nPlotting\nIn your ggplot(), you will need to specify geom_abline(). This might help get you started:\n\n geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope) \n\n\nYou may also want to plot these side by side to more easily compare, so consider using | from patchwork. For further ggplot() guidance, see the how to visualise data flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nFirst extract the values required for both non-standardized and standardized models:\n\n#non-standardized (from 'mdl')\nbetas &lt;- coef(mdl)\nintercept &lt;- betas[1]\nslope &lt;- betas[2]\n\n#standardized (from 'mdl_z')\nbetas_z &lt;- coef(mdl_z)\nintercept_z &lt;- betas_z[1]\nslope_z &lt;- betas_z[2]\n\nWe can plot the models as follows:\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope, color = 'blue') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = z_social_int, y = z_wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept_z, slope = slope_z, color = 'red') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week; Z-Scored)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores; Z-Scored\")\n\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities\n\nThe data points are distributed in the same pattern\n\nThe slope of the line follows the same gradient\n\nDifferences\n\nThe x- and y-axis scales are different for each plot. This is because:\n\nThe unstandardized is in the original units where we interpret the slope as the change in \\(y\\) units for a unit change in \\(x\\)\n\nThe standardized is in SD units where we interpret the slope as the SD change in \\(y\\) for 1 SD change in \\(x\\)"

As presented in Table 1, outdoor time was significantly associated with wellbeing scores \\((\\beta = 0.26, SE = 0.07, p &lt; .001)\\) after controlling for the number of weekly social interactions. Results suggested that, holding constant social interactions, for every standard deviation increase in outdoor time, wellbeing scores increased on average by 0.26 standard deviations.

The simulated data are based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the following paper:\nRozgonjuk, D., Sindermann, C., Elhai, J. D., & Montag, C. (2021). Individual differences in Fear of Missing Out (FoMO): Age, gender, and the Big Five personality trait domains, facets, and items. Personality and Individual Differences, 171, 110546. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110546\nIn the current study, participants were invited to an online study investigating the associations among FoMO, socio-demographic factors, and personality. The final sample comprised 3370 people. Participants completed a FOMO scale and a personality inventory. The 10-item FOMO scale measured the extent of experiencing apprehension regarding missing out on interesting events of others on a 5-point scale (1 = “not at all true of me” to 5 = “extremely true of me”), producing a possible range of scores between 10 and 50. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a 45-item personality assessment questionnaire (note that only 43 items were used to match the study above) that uses a five-point response scale (1 = “very inapplicable” to 5 = “very applicable”). The BFI consists of five domains: Neuroticism (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Extraversion (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Openness to Experience (10 items; possible range of scores 10-50), Agreeableness (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), and Conscientiousness (9 items; possible range of scores 9-45). We extended the aforementioned study to include an extra socio-demographic variable - a measure of popularity on social media based on the number of followers. Unlike the original study, we do not have measures of gender, education level, or specific country of residence.\nData Dictionary\nThe data in FOMOdataset.csv contain eight attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=3370\\) hypothetical individuals across the UK, and include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nFOMO\nFoMO Score (as measured by the 10-item FoMO scale)\n\n\nAge\nAge (in years)\n\n\nN\nScore on personality items assessing Neuroticism from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nE\nScore on personality items assessing Extraversion from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nO\nScore on personality items assessing Openness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nA\nScore on personality items assessing Agreeableness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nC\nScore on personality items assessing Conscientiousness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nTotalFollowers\nTotal Number of Instagram Followers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOMO\n      Age\n      N\n      E\n      O\n      A\n      C\n      TotalFollowers\n    \n\n\n28\n38\n26\n30\n32\n27\n38\n98\n\n\n26\n30\n23\n27\n33\n32\n30\n192\n\n\n23\n33\n14\n30\n36\n27\n24\n177\n\n\n18\n44\n26\n21\n37\n28\n34\n119\n\n\n19\n43\n32\n21\n41\n35\n40\n278\n\n\n24\n43\n22\n25\n31\n30\n24\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the FOMO dataset into R, assigning it to an object named fomo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\n\n#Reading in fomo data and storing in object named 'fomo'\nfomo &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/FOMOdataset.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows\nhead(fomo)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n   FOMO   Age     N     E     O     A     C TotalFollowers\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    28    38    26    30    32    27    38             98\n2    26    30    23    27    33    32    30            192\n3    23    33    14    30    36    27    24            177\n4    18    44    26    21    37    28    34            119\n5    19    43    32    21    41    35    40            278\n6    24    43    22    25    31    30    24            184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

    "text": "Study Overview\n\nResearch Aim\nExplore the associations among Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), age, social media networks, and the Big Five personality traits.\nResearch Questions\n\nRQ1: Does age predict FoMO?\nRQ2: Does the number of Instagram followers explain a significant amount of variance in FoMO over and above age?\nRQ3: Does personality predict FoMO?\n\n\n\n FoMO data codebook.\n\n\nDescription\nThe data used for this write-up exercise are simulated, drawing on recent work on Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), socio-demographic factors, and the Big Five personality traits. The simulated data are based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the following paper:\nRozgonjuk, D., Sindermann, C., Elhai, J. D., & Montag, C. (2021). Individual differences in Fear of Missing Out (FoMO): Age, gender, and the Big Five personality trait domains, facets, and items. Personality and Individual Differences, 171, 110546. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110546\nIn the current study, participants were invited to an online study investigating the associations among FoMO, socio-demographic factors, and personality. The final sample comprised 3370 people. Participants completed a FOMO scale and a personality inventory. The 10-item FOMO scale measured the extent of experiencing apprehension regarding missing out on interesting events of others on a 5-point scale (1 = “not at all true of me” to 5 = “extremely true of me”), producing a possible range of scores between 10 and 50. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a 45-item personality assessment questionnaire (note that only 43 items were used to match the study above) that uses a five-point response scale (1 = “very inapplicable” to 5 = “very applicable”). The BFI consists of five domains: Neuroticism (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Extraversion (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Openness to Experience (10 items; possible range of scores 10-50), Agreeableness (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), and Conscientiousness (9 items; possible range of scores 9-45). We extended the aforementioned study to include an extra socio-demographic variable - a measure of popularity on social media based on the number of followers. Unlike the original study, we do not have measures of gender, education level, or specific country of residence.\nData Dictionary\nThe data in FOMOdataset.csv contain eight attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=3370\\) hypothetical individuals across the UK, and include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nFOMO\nFoMO Score (as measured by the 10-item FoMO scale)\n\n\nAge\nAge (in years)\n\n\nN\nScore on personality items assessing Neuroticism from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nE\nScore on personality items assessing Extraversion from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nO\nScore on personality items assessing Openness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nA\nScore on personality items assessing Agreeableness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nC\nScore on personality items assessing Conscientiousness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nTotalFollowers\nTotal Number of Instagram Followers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOMO\n      Age\n      N\n      E\n      O\n      A\n      C\n      TotalFollowers\n    \n\n\n28\n38\n26\n30\n32\n27\n38\n98\n\n\n26\n30\n23\n27\n33\n32\n30\n192\n\n\n23\n33\n14\n30\n36\n27\n24\n177\n\n\n18\n44\n26\n21\n37\n28\n34\n119\n\n\n19\n43\n32\n21\n41\n35\n40\n278\n\n\n24\n43\n22\n25\n31\n30\n24\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the FOMO dataset into R, assigning it to an object named fomo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\n\n#Reading in fomo data and storing in object named 'fomo'\nfomo &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/FOMOdataset.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows\nhead(fomo)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n   FOMO   Age     N     E     O     A     C TotalFollowers\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    28    38    26    30    32    27    38             98\n2    26    30    23    27    33    32    30            192\n3    23    33    14    30    36    27    24            177\n4    18    44    26    21    37    28    34            119\n5    19    43    32    21    41    35    40            278\n6    24    43    22    25    31    30    24            184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

Let’s correct this.\n\n#Code treatment as a factor\ncaffeine &lt;- caffeine %&gt;%\n  mutate(treatment = as_factor(treatment))\n\nNext, let’s look at the ‘wpm’ variable. Here we want to check for impossible values.

The statistical models flashcards may also be useful to refer to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe caffeine dataset contained information on 40 hypothetical participants who took part in an experiment examining whether the number of words typed per minute (WPM) differed among caffeine treatment conditions. Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ WPM (average number of words typed per minute), and which one of four treatment conditions they were randomly assigned to (Control (Water), Coffee, Mint Tea, or Red Bull).\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among WPM and caffeine treatment conditions. To address the research question of whether WPM differs by caffeine treatment condition, we first need to define the dummy variables for Treatment:\n\\[\n\\text{Treatment}_\\text{Coffee} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Coffee} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad    \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Treatment}_\\text{Red Bull} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Red Bull} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\\\  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad  \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Treatment}_\\text{Mint Tea} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Mint Tea} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad  \n\\]\n\\[\n(\\text{Control (Water) is base level})  \n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following regression model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{WPM} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Treatment}_\\text{Coffee} \\\\    \n+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Treatment}_\\text{Red Bull} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Treatment}_\\text{Mint Tea} + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nThere are no differences in WPM based on caffeine treatment condition.\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nThere are differences in WPM based on caffeine treatment condition."

They hypothesised that sleep deprived individuals would have slower reaction times than non-sleep deprived individuals.\nTo test this, they recruited 60 participants who were matched on a number of demographic variables including age and sex. One member of each pair (e.g., female, aged 18) was placed into a different sleep condition - ‘Sleep Deprived’ (4 hours per night) or ‘Non-Sleep Deprived’ (8 hours per night).\n\n\nA group of researchers were interested in replicating an experiment testing the Stroop Effect.\nThey recruited 50 participants who took part in Task A (word colour and meaning are congruent) and Task B (word colour and meaning are incongruent) where they were asked to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word. The order of presentation was counterbalanced across participants. The researchers hypothesised that participants would take significantly more time (‘response time’ measured in seconds) to complete Task B than Task A.\nYou can test yourself here for fun: Stroop Task\n\n\nA group of researchers wanted to test a hypothesised theory according to which patients with amnesia will have a deficit in explicit memory but not implicit memory. Huntingtons patients, on the other hand, will display the opposite: they will have no deficit in explicit memory, but will have a deficit in implicit memory.\nTo test this, researchers designed a study that included two variables: ‘Diagnosis’ (Amnesic, Huntingtons, Control) and ‘Task’ (Grammar, Classification, Recognition) where participants were randomly assigned to a Task condition. The first two tasks (Grammar and Classification) are known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the Recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 3\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: Matched pairs\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Sleep Condition and Reaction Time\nLevels of variables = Sleep Condition has 2 levels - Sleep Deprived and Non-Sleep Deprived; Reaction Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Sleep Condition - Non-Sleep Deprived because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how the sleep deprived group differed from the non-sleep deprived group.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Within-person: Repeated measures (this is a study design that you will learn more about in DAPR3!)\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Task and Response Time\nLevels of variables = Task has 2 levels - A and B; Response Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Task - A because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how response time in Task B differed from the response time in Task A.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: 3×3 factorial design\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Diagnosis and Task\nLevels of variables = Diagnosis has 3 levels - Amnesic, Huntingtons, and Control; Task has 3 levels - Grammar, Classification, and Recognition\nReference Groups = Diagnosis - Control; Task - Recognition.

They hypothesised that sleep deprived individuals would have slower reaction times than non-sleep deprived individuals.\nTo test this, they recruited 60 participants who were matched on a number of demographic variables including age and sex. One member of each pair (e.g., female, aged 18) was placed into a different sleep condition - ‘Sleep Deprived’ (4 hours per night) or ‘Non-Sleep Deprived’ (8 hours per night).\n\n\nA group of researchers were interested in replicating an experiment testing the Stroop Effect.\nThey recruited 50 participants who took part in Task A (word colour and meaning are congruent) and Task B (word colour and meaning are incongruent) where they were asked to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word. The order of presentation was counterbalanced across participants. The researchers hypothesised that participants would take significantly more time (‘response time’ measured in seconds) to complete Task B than Task A.\nYou can test yourself here for fun: Stroop Task\n\n\nA group of researchers wanted to test a hypothesised theory according to which patients with amnesia will have a deficit in explicit memory but not implicit memory. Huntingtons patients, on the other hand, will display the opposite: they will have no deficit in explicit memory, but will have a deficit in implicit memory.\nTo test this, researchers designed a study that included two variables: ‘Diagnosis’ (Amnesic, Huntingtons, Control) and ‘Task’ (Grammar, Classification, Recognition) where participants were randomly assigned to a Task condition. The first two tasks (Grammar and Classification) are known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the Recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 3\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: Matched pairs\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Sleep Condition and Reaction Time\nLevels of variables = Sleep Condition has 2 levels - Sleep Deprived and Non-Sleep Deprived; Reaction Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Sleep Condition - Non-Sleep Deprived because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how the sleep deprived group differed from the non-sleep deprived group.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Within-person: Repeated measures (this is a study design that you will learn more about in DAPR3!)\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Task and Response Time\nLevels of variables = Task has 2 levels - A and B; Response Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Task - A because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how response time in Task B differed from the response time in Task A.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: 3×3 factorial design\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Diagnosis and Task\nLevels of variables = Diagnosis has 3 levels - Amnesic, Huntingtons, and Control; Task has 3 levels - Grammar, Classification, and Recognition\nReference Groups = Diagnosis - Control; Task - Recognition.

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers had one of three types of music - classical, pop, or silence - played in a restaurant over 18 successive evenings.

There does appear to be evidence that some assumptions may have been violated, but to be sure we need to check each assumption individually with plots that are more suitable for a statistics report.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model satisfies the linearity assumption for wb_mdl1.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nHow you check this assumption depends on the number of predictors in your model:\n\nSingle predictor: Use either residual vs fitted values plot (plot(model, which = 1)), and/or a scatterplot with loess lines\n\nMultiple predictors: Use component-residual plots (also known as partial-residual plots) to check the assumption of linearity\n\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the linearity flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\ncrPlots(wb_mdl1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoother (the pink line) follows quite closely to a linear relationship (the dashed blue line), though there was some deviation. Overall, the evidence suggested that the linearity assumption was met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfy the equal variance (homoscedasticity) assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse residualPlots() to plot residuals against the predictor. Since we are only interested in visually assessing our assumption checks, we can suppress the curvature test output by specifying tests = FALSE.\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the equal variances (homoscedasticity) flashcard.\n\nQuick Tip if plotting using plot(model)\nAs the residuals can be positive or negative, we can make it easier to assess equal spread by improving the ‘resolution’ of the points.\nWe can make all residuals positive by discarding the sign (take the absolute value), and then take the square root to make them closer to each other.\nA plot of \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values can be obtained via plot(model, which = 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nWe can visually assess by plotting the Pearson residuals against the fitted values:\n\nresidualPlots(wb_mdl1, tests = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr by plotting the \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values:\n\nplot(wb_mdl1, which = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial residual plots did show non-linear trends between residuals and predictors, hence there is evidence of non-constant variance i.e., heteroscedasticity. Thus, the data did not meet the assumption of equal variance, as the spread of the standardized residuals did not appear to be constant (for the most part) as the fitted values varied.\nIn the second plot, all points are above 0, but the majority of the points are not very close to each other. The line does not appear to be relatively flat, and so this also suggested that the error variance does change across the fitted values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nAssess whether there is autocorrelation in the error terms.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption of independence to have been met (you may have to assume certain aspects of the study design).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the independence (of errors) flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our data were collected from a between-persons study design, we can assume (i.e., based on design, we believe) the errors to be independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfies the normality assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met.

There was some evidence of heavier tails, and we may want to examine some observations more closely (i.e., 16, 78, 109)."

A large DFbeta value would suggest that a case has a substantial impact on the estimated coefficients, and thus a high influence on the model results; a small DFbeta value would suggest that the case has less influence on the estimated coefficients.\nA commonly used cut-off or threshold to compare \\(|DFBETA|\\) values (absolute values) against is \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) (see Belsley et al., (1980) p. 28 for more info)2.\nFor our model:\n\\[\n|DFBETA_{cutoff}| \\quad = \\quad \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}} \\quad = \\quad  \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{200}}  = 0.141\n\\]\nIn order to extract these in order to arrange in descending order, we need to save our delete-1 measures of influence as a dataframe (via as.data.frame()).

To use it with ggplot(), we will need to turn it into a dataframe (as.data.frame()), or a tibble (as_tibble()):\n\ninfdata &lt;- inf_mes$infmat %&gt;%\n  as_tibble()\n\nNow we can build our plot. It would be useful to add vertical lines at the values \\(\\quad 1\\pm0.045\\). To do so, we can use the geom_vline() function:\n\nggplot(data = infdata, aes(x = cov.r)) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1-0.045), col = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1+0.045), col = \"red\")) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  #remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like a few observations may be having quite a strong influence on the standard errors here.

We may want to consider one of the approaches described in the next steps: what to do with violations of assumptions / problematic case diagnostic results flashcard."

    "text": "Assumptions\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nLet’s start by using check_model() for our wb_mdl1 model - we can refer to these plots as a guide as we work through the assumptions questions of the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the useful assumptions plots &gt; check_model() flaschard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots cannot be used in your reports - they are to be used as a guide only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\ncheck_model(wb_mdl1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe check_model() function is a useful way to check the assumptions of models, as it also returns some useful notes to aid your interpretation. There does appear to be evidence that some assumptions may have been violated, but to be sure we need to check each assumption individually with plots that are more suitable for a statistics report.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model satisfies the linearity assumption for wb_mdl1.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nHow you check this assumption depends on the number of predictors in your model:\n\nSingle predictor: Use either residual vs fitted values plot (plot(model, which = 1)), and/or a scatterplot with loess lines\n\nMultiple predictors: Use component-residual plots (also known as partial-residual plots) to check the assumption of linearity\n\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the linearity flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\ncrPlots(wb_mdl1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoother (the pink line) follows quite closely to a linear relationship (the dashed blue line), though there was some deviation. Overall, the evidence suggested that the linearity assumption was met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfy the equal variance (homoscedasticity) assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse residualPlots() to plot residuals against the predictor. Since we are only interested in visually assessing our assumption checks, we can suppress the curvature test output by specifying tests = FALSE.\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the equal variances (homoscedasticity) flashcard.\n\nQuick Tip if plotting using plot(model)\nAs the residuals can be positive or negative, we can make it easier to assess equal spread by improving the ‘resolution’ of the points.\nWe can make all residuals positive by discarding the sign (take the absolute value), and then take the square root to make them closer to each other.\nA plot of \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values can be obtained via plot(model, which = 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nWe can visually assess by plotting the Pearson residuals against the fitted values:\n\nresidualPlots(wb_mdl1, tests = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr by plotting the \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values:\n\nplot(wb_mdl1, which = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial residual plots did show non-linear trends between residuals and predictors, hence there is evidence of non-constant variance i.e., heteroscedasticity. Thus, the data did not meet the assumption of equal variance, as the spread of the standardized residuals did not appear to be constant (for the most part) as the fitted values varied.\nIn the second plot, all points are above 0, but the majority of the points are not very close to each other. The line does not appear to be relatively flat, and so this also suggested that the error variance does change across the fitted values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nAssess whether there is autocorrelation in the error terms.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption of independence to have been met (you may have to assume certain aspects of the study design).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the independence (of errors) flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our data were collected from a between-persons study design, we can assume (i.e., based on design, we believe) the errors to be independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfies the normality assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the normality (of errors) flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nQQ Plot\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = wb_mdl1$residuals)) +\n    geom_histogram() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram indicated that the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) followed close to a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(wb_mdl1, which = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QQplot indicated that the residuals followed close to a normal distribution, as the points followed a linear pattern and there was no substantial skew or departure from normality. There was some evidence of heavier tails, and we may want to examine some observations more closely (i.e., 16, 78, 109)."

To avoid returning 200 rows of output (i.e., the length of the dataframe), we can ask for the first 15 rows via (head(., 15)):\n\n#save as a dataframe\ninf_mes1 &lt;- as.data.frame(inf_mes$infmat)\n\n#arrange dfbeta values in descending order using the absolute value, and show first 10 rows\ninf_mes1 %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(abs(dfb.1_))) %&gt;%\n    head(., 15)\n\n        dfb.1_    dfb.otd_    dfb.scl_      dffit     cov.r      cook.d\n109 -0.4918246  0.32363373  0.49483157  0.6455776 0.8332377 0.129556799\n53   0.2430892 -0.26944443 -0.15351312 -0.3388798 0.9790122 0.037669317\n16   0.2060412 -0.13252138 -0.23259175 -0.3223359 0.9310954 0.033647762\n101 -0.1947109  0.09412063  0.15487642 -0.2046876 1.0063119 0.013897196\n179  0.1902832 -0.07096434 -0.16598552  0.2085435 0.9990240 0.014401828\n76   0.1730591 -0.02595756 -0.26823452 -0.3101290 0.9651183 0.031469445\n85  -0.1646134  0.10294561  0.11084731 -0.1711913 1.0143158 0.009748336\n149 -0.1638458  0.26658339  0.03742045  0.2934205 1.0039126 0.028443695\n56   0.1604565 -0.19478940 -0.02813891  0.2114811 1.0330872 0.014891276\n173 -0.1561237  0.10614219  0.15969174  0.2161367 1.0033339 0.015479111\n75   0.1457701 -0.07234892 -0.11988282  0.1497178 1.0393526 0.007484738\n50   0.1353661 -0.13659118 -0.12403587 -0.2437762 0.9485325 0.019390273\n26   0.1300856 -0.08559983 -0.13088097 -0.1707527 1.0263050 0.009715555\n58   0.1291280 -0.02591707 -0.21369424 -0.2756455 0.9405759 0.024709605\n78   0.1272542 -0.03198691 -0.22393152 -0.3200349 0.8802619 0.032611416\n            hat\n109 0.026614646\n53  0.026659223\n16  0.015112834\n101 0.020817727\n179 0.018565852\n76  0.020066684\n85  0.020304231\n149 0.030197659\n56  0.035297538\n173 0.020995260\n75  0.032859874\n50  0.011184976\n26  0.026614646\n58  0.012670376\n78  0.009904492\n\n\nWe can see that we have 11 \\(|DFBETA|\\) values &gt; \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{200}}\\), from observations (or rows) 16, 53, 56, 75, 76, 85, 101, 109, 149, 173, and 179 that we may want to examine further:\n\nwhich(abs(inf_mes1$dfb.1_) &gt; (2/sqrt(200)))\n\n [1]  16  53  56  75  76  85 101 109 149 173 179\n\n\n\n\nValues which are \\(&gt;1+\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) or \\(&lt;1-\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) are considered as having strong influence.\nFor our model, this is: \\[\n1 \\pm \\frac{3(k+1)}{n} \\quad = \\quad 1 \\pm\\frac{3(2+1)}{200} \\quad = \\quad 1\\pm \\frac{9}{200} \\quad = \\quad 1\\pm0.045\n\\]\nThe “infmat” bit of an infl-type object contains the numbers, as we can see from out output above. To use it with ggplot(), we will need to turn it into a dataframe (as.data.frame()), or a tibble (as_tibble()):\n\ninfdata &lt;- inf_mes$infmat %&gt;%\n  as_tibble()\n\nNow we can build our plot. It would be useful to add vertical lines at the values \\(\\quad 1\\pm0.045\\). To do so, we can use the geom_vline() function:\n\nggplot(data = infdata, aes(x = cov.r)) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1-0.045), col = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1+0.045), col = \"red\")) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  #remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like a few observations may be having quite a strong influence on the standard errors here. We can check specifically how many observations are potentially having a having strong influence using the cut off \\(1\\pm0.045\\):\n\ntable(infdata$cov.r &lt; 1 - 0.045 | infdata$cov.r &gt; 1 + 0.045)\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  185    15 \n\n\nWe can identify these 15 observations to investigate further:\n\nwhich(infdata$cov.r &lt; 1 - 0.045 | infdata$cov.r &gt; 1 + 0.045)\n\n [1]  16  25  50  58  62  72  73  78  79 109 127 151 159 165 176\n\n\nWe know that observations (or rows) 16, 25, 50, 58, 62, 72, 73, 78, 79, 109, 127, 151, 159, 165, and 176 have \\(\\text{COVRATIO  } 1\\pm0.045\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\nWhat approaches would be appropriate to take given the issues highlighted above with the violations of assumptions and case diagnostic results?\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThere are lots of different options available to us.

To understand the strength of association among the variables, we will estimate the the correlation coefficients. To address the research question of whether there is an association between people’s scientific knowledge and their attitudes towards science and faith after accounting for their age, we are going to fit the following multiple linear regression model:\n\\[\n\\text{Attitude} = \\beta_0  + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Science Knowledge} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age} + \\epsilon\n\\] Effects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\).\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\): There is no association between people’s scientific knowledge and their attitudes towards science and faith after accounting for their age\n\\(H_1: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\): There is an association between people’s scientific knowledge and their attitudes towards science and faith after accounting for their age"

Hence, in this example, the intercept itself isn’t very informative.\n\nA way to improve the model here to aid interpretation would be to mean centre age, and then refit the model with the mean centred age variable!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint - Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis represents the average marginal effect of \\(X1\\) on \\(Y\\), and can be interpreted as the expected change in \\(Y\\) for a one-unit increase in \\(X1\\) controlling for \\(X2\\).

Results suggested that there was a negative and statistically significant association between attitudes towards science and faith and scientific knowledge after controlling for age \\((\\beta = -0.08, CI_{95}[-0.09, -0.07])\\). Since the 95% CI did not contain zero, we rejected the null hypothesis as there was evidence of an association between peoples’ attitudes towards science and faith and their scientific knowledge after accounting for their age. Specifically, results suggested that for every additional quiz question people got correct, we expected their attitude score to be lower by about 0.08 points, holding age constant. In other words, respondents with greater scientific knowledge tended to be more favorable towards it, regardless of their age."

This represents the expected attitude towards science and faith score when all other variables were zero.\nIn this case, only a handful of respondents had a scientific knowledge quiz score of zero, and nobody was aged zero. Hence, in this example, the intercept itself isn’t very informative.\n\nA way to improve the model here to aid interpretation would be to mean centre age, and then refit the model with the mean centred age variable!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint - Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis represents the average marginal effect of \\(X1\\) on \\(Y\\), and can be interpreted as the expected change in \\(Y\\) for a one-unit increase in \\(X1\\) controlling for \\(X2\\). See Semester 1 Week 5 Lab for a recap on interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nAs presented in Table 3, the estimated value for the scientific knowledge slope was estimated to be approximately -0.08\nResults suggested that, holding age constant, for every one point increase in scientific knowledge quiz scores, attitude scores decreased by 0.08 points.\nKeeping in mind the valence of the question wording, this means that those who were more knowledgeable of science tended to be more favorable towards science – i.e. disagreeing with the statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint - Interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis represents the average marginal effect of \\(X2\\) on \\(Y\\), and can be interpreted as the expected change in \\(Y\\) for a one-unit increase in \\(X2\\) controlling for \\(X1\\).

Results suggested that there was a negative and statistically significant association between attitudes towards science and faith and scientific knowledge after controlling for age \\((\\beta = -0.08, CI_{95}[-0.09, -0.07])\\). Since the 95% CI did not contain zero, we rejected the null hypothesis as there was evidence of an association between peoples’ attitudes towards science and faith and their scientific knowledge after accounting for their age. Specifically, results suggested that for every additional quiz question people got correct, we expected their attitude score to be lower by about 0.08 points, holding age constant. In other words, respondents with greater scientific knowledge tended to be more favorable towards it, regardless of their age."

The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nCredé, M., Roch, S. G., & Kieszczynka, U. M. (2010). Class attendance in college: A meta-analytic review of the relationship of class attendance with grades and student characteristics. Review of Educational Research, 80(2), 272-295. https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654310362998\nThe current study was split into two parts. In the first, researchers were interested in further exploring possible predictors of attendance in university courses. They collected information from 397 students across all years of study (i.e., UG (Y1 - Y4), MSc, and PhD), and recorded their class attendance across the academic year, their level of Conscientiousness (categorized as Low, Moderate, or High), the frequency of which they accessed online course materials (categorized as Rarely, Sometimes, or Often), and the timing of class (categorized as 9AM, 10AM, 11AM, 12PM 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM).

    "text": "Study Overview\n\nResearch Aim\nExplore the associations among academic outcomes, student/course characteristics (e.g., class time, online access), and attendance.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nRQ1: Does conscientiousness, frequency of access to online materials, and year of study in University predict course attendance?\nRQ2: Is there a difference in attendance between those with early/late classes in comparison to those with midday classes?\nRQ3: Is class attendance associated with final grades?\n\n\n\n Academics data codebook.\n\n\nDescription\nThe data used for this write-up exercise are simulated, drawing on a meta-analysis that explored the association between student characteristics and grades. The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nCredé, M., Roch, S. G., & Kieszczynka, U. M. (2010). Class attendance in college: A meta-analytic review of the relationship of class attendance with grades and student characteristics. Review of Educational Research, 80(2), 272-295. https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654310362998\nThe current study was split into two parts. In the first, researchers were interested in further exploring possible predictors of attendance in university courses. They collected information from 397 students across all years of study (i.e., UG (Y1 - Y4), MSc, and PhD), and recorded their class attendance across the academic year, their level of Conscientiousness (categorized as Low, Moderate, or High), the frequency of which they accessed online course materials (categorized as Rarely, Sometimes, or Often), and the timing of class (categorized as 9AM, 10AM, 11AM, 12PM 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM). In the second, researchers collected data from 200 students, and recorded their class attendance across the academic year and their final course grade.\nData Dictionary: Part 1\nThe data in DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1 contain six attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=397\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\npid\nParticipant ID number\n\n\nAttendance\nTotal attendance (in days)\n\n\nConscientiousness\nConscientiousness (Levels: Low, Moderate, High)\n\n\nTime\nTime of Class (Levels: 9AM, 10AM, 11AM, 12PM, 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM)\n\n\nOnlineAccess\nFrequency of access to online course materials (Levels: Rarely, Sometimes, Often)\n\n\nYear\nYear of Study in University (Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, MsC, PhD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview: Part 1\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npid\n      Attendance\n      Conscientiousness\n      Time\n      OnlineAccess\n      Year\n    \n\n\n1\n9\nHigh\n3PM\nOften\nY3\n\n\n2\n10\nHigh\n2PM\nOften\nY3\n\n\n3\n0\nLow\n10AM\nRarely\nY2\n\n\n4\n8\nLow\n4PM\nOften\nY4\n\n\n5\n6\nHigh\n4PM\nSometimes\nY1\n\n\n6\n6\nHigh\n9AM\nSometimes\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary: Part 2\nThe data in DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2 contain two attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=200\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nMarks\nFinal grade (0-100)\n\n\nAttendance\nTotal attendance (in days)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview: Part 2\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks\n      Attendance\n    \n\n\n25.18480\n10.5\n\n\n25.83144\n11.0\n\n\n25.42314\n11.5\n\n\n26.36523\n12.0\n\n\n27.44285\n12.5\n\n\n29.04029\n13.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1 and DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2 datasets into R, assigning them to objects named data1 and data2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(car)\n\n#Reading in two datasets and store in objects named 'data1' and  'data2'\ndata1 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows of each dataset\nhead(data1)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n    pid Attendance Conscientiousness Time  OnlineAccess Year \n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;\n1     1          9 High              3PM   Often        Y3   \n2     2         10 High              2PM   Often        Y3   \n3     3          0 Low               10AM  Rarely       Y2   \n4     4          8 Low               4PM   Often        Y4   \n5     5          6 High              4PM   Sometimes    Y1   \n6     6          6 High              9AM   Sometimes    Y1   \n\nhead(data2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  Marks Attendance\n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  25.2       10.5\n2  25.8       11  \n3  25.4       11.5\n4  26.4       12  \n5  27.4       12.5\n6  29.0       13  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

    "text": "Numeric Exploration\nNumeric exploration of data involves examining key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation via descriptives tables; and assessing the associations among variables through correlation coefficients. Exploring our data numerically helps us to identify patterns and associations in the data.\nDescriptives\n\n Descriptives Tables\n\n\nThere are numerous packages available that allow us to pull out descriptive statistics from our dataset such as tidyverse and psych.\nWhen we pull out descriptive statistics, it is useful to present these in a well formatted table for your reader. There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the kable() function from the package kableExtra.\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via caption = \"insert caption here\", align values within columns e.g., center aligned via align = \"??\"), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via digits = ??).\nWe can also add in the function kable_styling(). This is really helpful for customsing your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!).\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp\n\n\n\n\n Descriptives Tables - Examples\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse way\nThe psych way\n\n\n\nWe can use the summarise() function to numerically summarise/describe our data. Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via mean(), standard deviation (via sd()), minimum value (via min()), maximum value (via max()), standard error (via se()), and skewness (via skew()).\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\nM_Length\nSD_Length\n\n\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe describe() function will produce a table of descriptive statistics. If you would like only a subset of this output (e.g., mean, sd), you can use select() after calling describe() e.g., describe() %&gt;% select(mean, sd).\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# we want to get descriptive statistics of the iris dataset, specifically the sepal length column\n# we specifically want to select the mean and standard deviation from the descriptive statistics available (try this without including this argument to see what values you all get out)\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\ndescribe(iris$Sepal.Length) %&gt;%\n    select(mean, sd) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\n\nmean\nsd\n\n\nX1\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation\n\n Correlation Coefficient\n\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a standardised number which quantifies the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. In a population it is denoted by \\(\\rho\\), and in a sample it is denoted by \\(r\\).\nValues of \\(r\\) fall between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). How to interpret:\n\nSize: More extreme values (i.e., the The closer \\(r\\) is to \\(+/- 1\\)) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to \\(0\\) a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n\nWeak = \\(.1 &lt; |r| &lt; .3\\)\n\nModerate = \\(.3 &lt; |r| &lt; .5\\)\n\nStrong = \\(|r| &gt; .5\\)\n\n\n\nDirection: The sign of \\(r\\) says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n\nPositive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\nNegative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation Matrix\n\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients - \\(r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}\\) - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).\n\nIn R\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the cor() function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables must be numeric.\n\nLet’s check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe can see that the variable Species in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to subset, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside [], or using select(). In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\nIf you had NA values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these NAs using na.rm = TRUE inside the cor() function.\n\n\nIndex dataframe ([])\nVariable selection (select())\n\n\n\n\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) %&gt;%\n  cor() %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the population parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., \\(\\rho\\)).\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho = 0\\).

    "text": "Visual Exploration\nVisual exploration of our data allows us to visualize the distributions of our data, and to identify potential associations between variables.\n\n How to Visualise Data\n\n\nTo visualise (i.e., plot) our data, we can use ggplot() from the tidyverse package. Note the key components of the ggplot() code:\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the \\(x\\)-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n\n+ geom_... = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes().\n\nlabs() = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., bins =, alpha =, fill =, linewidth =. linetype =, size = etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using ? - e.g., ?fill\nIf you’d like to read more about ggplot(), there is a handy cheatsheet.\n\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:\n\nUse to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels\n\nThe patchwork package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - | arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and / arranges the plots on top of one another\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Marginal Examples\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nDensity\n\n\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width.\nBasic:\n\nx-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\ny-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n\nWhat are bins?: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bins:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify bins = to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can specify binwidth = to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify color = to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"red\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify fill = to fill the columns with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"purple\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visualization of the distribution of a numeric variable.\nBasic:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilled:\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying fill = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Type & Width:\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying linetype = and linewidth = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Bivariate Examples\n\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within aes(), to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis.\n\nScatterplot\n\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values.\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a cloud of scattered points.\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\n\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill points with color:\nWithin geom_point(), we can specify color = to fill the points with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"orange\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange size and opacity:\nWe can change the size (using size =) and the opacity (using alpha =) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")"

Here is how we would do this in R:\n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\ntab_model(mdl_test,\n          pred.labels = c('Intercept', 'socio-economic status', 'age - in years'),\n          title = \"Regression Table for Cognitive Scores Model\")\n\nSee here for another short example."

    "text": "Numeric Exploration\nNumeric exploration of data involves examining key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation via descriptives tables; and assessing the associations among variables through correlation coefficients. Exploring our data numerically helps us to identify patterns and associations in the data.\nDescriptives\n\n Descriptives Tables\n\n\nThere are numerous packages available that allow us to pull out descriptive statistics from our dataset such as tidyverse and psych.\nWhen we pull out descriptive statistics, it is useful to present these in a well formatted table for your reader. There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the kable() function from the package kableExtra.\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via caption = \"insert caption here\", align values within columns e.g., center aligned via align = \"??\"), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via digits = ??).\nWe can also add in the function kable_styling(). This is really helpful for customising your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!).\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp\n\n\n\n\n\n Descriptives Tables - Examples\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse way\nThe psych way\n\n\n\nWe can use the summarise() function to numerically summarise/describe our data. Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via mean(), standard deviation (via sd()), minimum value (via min()), maximum value (via max()), standard error (via se()), and skewness (via skew()).\n\n\nNumeric values only example:\nCategorical and numeric values example:\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\nM_Length\nSD_Length\n\n\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# grouping by Species\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table of sepal length grouped by species with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %&gt;%\n    group_by(Species) %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length (in cm) Grouped by Species Descriptives Table\", digits = 2) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length (in cm) Grouped by Species Descriptives Table\n\nSpecies\nM_Length\nSD_Length\n\n\n\nsetosa\n5.01\n0.35\n\n\nversicolor\n5.94\n0.52\n\n\nvirginica\n6.59\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe describe() function will produce a table of descriptive statistics.

In a population it is denoted by \\(\\rho\\), and in a sample it is denoted by \\(r\\).\nValues of \\(r\\) fall between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). How to interpret:\n\nSize: More extreme values (i.e., the The closer \\(r\\) is to \\(+/- 1\\)) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to \\(0\\) a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n\nWeak = \\(.1 &lt; |r| &lt; .3\\)\n\nModerate = \\(.3 &lt; |r| &lt; .5\\)\n\nStrong = \\(|r| &gt; .5\\)\n\n\n\nDirection: The sign of \\(r\\) says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n\nPositive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\nNegative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation Matrix\n\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients - \\(r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}\\) - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).\n\nIn R\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the cor() function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables must be numeric.\n\nLet’s check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe can see that the variable Species in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to subset, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside [], or using select(). In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\nIf you had NA values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these NAs using na.rm = TRUE inside the cor() function.\n\n\nIndex dataframe ([])\nVariable selection (select())\n\n\n\n\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) %&gt;%\n  cor() %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the population parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., \\(\\rho\\)).\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho = 0\\).

    "text": "Visual Exploration\nVisual exploration of our data allows us to visualize the distributions of our data, and to identify potential associations between variables.\n\n How to Visualise Data\n\n\nTo visualise (i.e., plot) our data, we can use ggplot() from the tidyverse package. Note the key components of the ggplot() code:\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the \\(x\\)-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n\n+ geom_... = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes().\n\nlabs() = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., bins =, alpha =, fill =, linewidth =. linetype =, size = etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using ? - e.g., ?fill\nIf you’d like to read more about ggplot(), there is a handy cheatsheet.\n\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:\n\nUse to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels\n\nThe patchwork package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - | arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and / arranges the plots on top of one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Marginal Examples\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nDensity\n\n\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width.\nBasic:\n\nx-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\ny-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n\nWhat are bins?: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bins:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify bins = to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can specify binwidth = to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify color = to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"red\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify fill = to fill the columns with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"purple\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visualization of the distribution of a numeric variable.\nBasic:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilled:\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying fill = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Type & Width:\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying linetype = and linewidth = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Bivariate Examples\n\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within aes(), to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis.\n\n\nScatterplot\nBoxplot\nFacets\n\n\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values.\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a cloud of scattered points.\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\n\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill points with color:\nWithin geom_point(), we can specify color = to fill the points with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"orange\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange size and opacity:\nWe can change the size (using size =) and the opacity (using alpha =) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth().

    "text": "Numeric Outcomes & Predictors\n\n Simple Linear Regression Models - Example\n\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether there was an association between recall accuracy and age. You have been provided with data from twenty participants who studied passages of text (c500 words long), and were tested a week later. The testing phase presented participants with 100 statements about the text. They had to answer whether each statement was true or false, as well as rate their confidence in each answer (on a sliding scale from 0 to 100). The dataset contains, for each participant, the percentage of items correctly answered, their age (in years), and their average confidence rating.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/recalldata.csv\nWe could specify our model as:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall Accuracy}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\nand fit our model in R as\n\n#specify model\nrecall_simp &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n#look at model coefficients\nrecall_simp\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          age  \n    84.0153      -0.3026  \n\n\nWhen we call the name of the fitted model, recall_simp, you can see the estimated regression coefficients \\(\\hat \\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\). The line of best-fit is thus given by:1\n\\[\n\\widehat{Recall~Accuracy} = 84.02 - 0.31 \\cdot \\text{Age}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification\n\n\nMultiple linear regression involves looking at one continuous outcome (i.e., DV), with two or more independent variables (i.e., IVs).\nA multiple linear regression model takes the following form:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon_i\n\\] \\[\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\] So, for example, we could extend our recall accuracy model to include recall confidence as a predictor:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall Accuracy}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Recall Confidence}_i + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\n\nIn R:\nMultiple and simple linear regression follow the same structure within the lm() function - the logic scales up to however many predictor variables we want to include in our model. You simply add (using the + sign) more independent variables. For example, if we wanted to build a multiple linear regression that included three independent variables, we could fit one of the following via the lm() function:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV1 + data_name$IV2 + data_name$IV3)\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Multiple Regression Coefficients\nYou’ll hear a lot of different ways that people explain multiple regression coefficients.\nFor the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon\\), the estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) will often be reported as:\n“the increase in \\(y\\) for a one unit increase in \\(x_1\\) when…”\n\n“holding the effect of \\(x_2\\) constant.”\n“controlling for differences in \\(x_2\\).”\n“partialling out the effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n“holding \\(x_2\\) equal.”\n“accounting for effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n\nFor models with 3+ predictors, just like building the model in R, the logic of the above simply extends.\nFor example “the increase in [outcome] for a one unit increase in [predictor] when…”\n\n“holding [other predictors] constant.”\n\n“accounting for [other predictors].”\n\n“controlling for differences in [other predictors].”\n\n“partialling out the effects of [other predictors].”\n\n“holding [other predictors] equal.”\n\n“accounting for effects of [other predictors].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Simple Linear Regression Models - Visualisation\n\n\nAs we saw above, the line representing the relationship between side and perimeter of squares is able to predict the actual perimeter value from the measurement of the side of a square.\nThis is possible because the association between side and perimeter is an exact one. That is, any squares having the same side will have the same perimeter, and there will be no variation in those values.\nThe line that best fits the association between recall accuracy and age (see Figure 2), instead, is only able to predict the average accuracy for a given value of age.\nThis is because there will be a distribution of recall accuracy at each value of age. The line will fit the trend/pattern in the values, but there will be individual-to-individual variability that we must accept around that average pattern.\n\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + \n    labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", y = \"Recall Accuracy (%)\")\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Association between Recall Accuracy and Age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multiple Linear Regression Models - Visualisation\n\n\nWhen we have 2+ predictors, we can’t just plot our data an add geom_smooth(method=lm), because that would give a visualisation of a linear model with just one predictor (whichever one is on the x-axis).\nInstead, we can use the function plot_model() from sjPlot. Here’s an example with our recall accuracy model, with two predictors (recall confidence and age):\n\nplot_model(recall_mdl,\n           type = \"eff\",\n           terms = \"recall_confidence\",\n           show.data = TRUE)\n\nplot_model(recall_mdl,\n           type = \"eff\",\n           terms = \"age\",\n           show.data = TRUE)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Association between Recall Accuracy, Recall Confidence and Age\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Association between Recall Accuracy, Recall Confidence and Age"

    "section": "Numeric Outcomes & Categorical Predictors",
    "text": "Numeric Outcomes & Categorical Predictors\n\n Overview\n\n\nWe can include categorical predictors in a linear regression, but the interpretation of the coefficients is very specific. Whereas we talked about coefficients being interpreted as “the change in \\(y\\) associated with a 1-unit increase in \\(x\\)”, for categorical explanatory variables, coefficients can be considered to examine differences in group means.\n\n\n\n\n\n Coding Variables as Factors\n\n\nWhen we have categorical predictors, it is important that we tell R specifically to code them appropriately as factors.\n\nIn R\nWe can use various functions to convert between different types of data, such as:\n\n\nfactor() / as_factor() - to turn a variable into a factor\n\n\nas.numeric() - to turn a variable into numbers\n\n\nAs a first step, it is a good idea to look at the structure of the dataset you are working with. For the purpose of this example, our dataset is called “tips” (you might recall this from DAPR1):\n\nstr(tips)\n\nspc_tbl_ [157 × 7] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: chr [1:157] \"n\" \"n\" \"y\" \"y\" ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   Bill = col_double(),\n  ..   Tip = col_double(),\n  ..   Credit = col_character(),\n  ..   Guests = col_double(),\n  ..   Day = col_character(),\n  ..   Server = col_character(),\n  ..   PctTip = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n\nFrom the output, we can see that Credit (whether guests paid with a credit card; n/y responses) was coded as a &lt;chr&gt; or character variable. If we wanted to set this as a factor so that R recognises it as a categorical variable, we can use on of the following:\n\n\nas_factor()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\ntips &lt;- tips %&gt;% \n  mutate(Credit = as_factor(Credit))\n\n\n\nWe could also use the factor() function, and at the same time label factors appropriately to aid reader interpretation (it may not be immediately clear to some that n represents ‘No’ and y represents ‘Yes’). To do so, we list the all levels of Credit, and provide a new label corresponding to each level:\n\ntips$Credit &lt;- factor(tips$Credit, \n                      levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                      labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n\n\n\n\nUsing either of the above approaches, if we now run str(tips) again, you should see that Credit is now coded as a factor with 2 levels:\n\nstr(tips)\n\ntibble [157 × 7] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: Factor w/ 2 levels \"n\",\"y\": 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Binary Predictors\n\n\nBinary variables have two categories (more commonly referred to as levels), and these levels (e.g., Yes/No, Dog/Cat, Right/Left, Smoker/Non-Smoker) are simply entered in the model as a series of 0s and 1s. Numeric variables that represent categorical data are typically referred to as dummy variables.\nOur coefficients are just the same as before. The intercept is where our predictor equals zero, and the slope is the change in our outcome variable associated with a 1-unit change in our predictor.\nHowever, “zero” for this predictor variable now corresponds to a whole level. This is known as the “reference level”. Accordingly, the 1-unit change in our predictor (the move from “zero” to “one”) corresponds to the difference between the two levels.\nWhen used as predictors in multiple regression models, binary variables behave much the same way. The coefficient will give us the estimated change in \\(y\\) when moving from one level to the other, whilst holding other predictors constant (for more info, see the Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification flashcard, specifically the section on interpretation of multiple regression coefficients).\n\n\n\n\n\n Categorical Predictors with k levels\n\n\nWhen we have a categorical explanatory variable with more than 2 levels, our model gets a bit more complex - it needs not just one, but a number of dummy variables. For a categorical variable with \\(k\\) levels, we can express it in \\(k-1\\) dummy variables.\nFor example, the “species” column below has three levels, and can be expressed by the two variables “species_dog” and “species_parrot”:\n\n\n  species species_dog species_parrot\n1     cat           0              0\n2     cat           0              0\n3     dog           1              0\n4  parrot           0              1\n5     dog           1              0\n6     cat           0              0\n7     ...         ...            ...\n\n\n\nThe “cat” level is expressed whenever both the “species_dog” and “species_parrot” variables are 0.\nThe “dog” level is expressed whenever the “species_dog” variable is 1 and the “species_parrot” variable is 0.\nThe “parrot” level is expressed whenever the “species_dog” variable is 0 and the “species_parrot” variable is 1.\n\nR will do all of this re-expression for us. If we include in our model a categorical explanatory variable with 3 different levels, the model will estimate 2 parameters - one for each dummy variable. We can interpret the parameter estimates (the coefficients we obtain using coefficients(),coef() or summary()) as the estimated increase in the outcome variable associated with an increase of one in each dummy variable (holding all other variables equal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt value\nPr(&gt;|t|)\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n60.28\n1.209\n49.86\n5.273e-39\n\n\nspeciesdog\n-11.47\n1.71\n-6.708\n3.806e-08\n\n\nspeciesparrot\n-4.916\n1.71\n-2.875\n0.006319\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the intercept is the estimated outcome when all predictors are zero. In our example then, this represents the cat. We think of the “cat” category in this example as the reference level - it is the category against which other categories are compared against. Therefore, in the above example, an increase in 1 of “species_dog” is the difference between a “cat” and a “dog”. An increase in one of “species_parrot” is the difference between a “cat” and a “parrot”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dummy vs Effects Coding\n\n\nPossible side-constraints on the parameters are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nConstraint\nMeaning of \\(\\beta_0\\)\n\nR\n\n\n\nSum to zero (Effects Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu\\)\ncontr.sum\n\n\nReference group (Dummy Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu_1\\)\ncontr.treatment\n\n\n\nDummy Coding\nBy default R uses the reference group constraint - i.e., dummy coding (sometimes called treatment contrast coding). If your factor has \\(g\\) levels, your regression model will have \\(g-1\\) dummy variables (R creates them for you, as we’ve seen in the examples above).\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated \\(y\\) when all predictors (i.e., \\(x\\)’s) are zero. Because the reference level is kind of like “0” in our contrast matrix, this is part of the intercept estimate. We get out a coefficient for each subsequent level, which are the estimated differences from each level to the reference group.\nEffects Coding\nEffects coding (sometimes called sum-to-zero coding) is the next most commonly used in psychological research. These are a way of comparing each level to the overall (or grand) mean. This involves a bit of trickery that uses -1s and 1s rather than 0s and 1s, in order to make “0” be mid-way between all the levels - the average of the levels.\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated average \\(y\\) when averaged across all levels of the predictor variable. In other words, it is the estimated grand mean of \\(y\\). The coefficients represent the estimated difference for that level from the overall grand mean.\n\nIn R\nIf we want to use effects coding, we can apply:\n\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.sum\"\n\nWe can switch back to the default reference group constraint by applying either of these:\n\n# Option 1\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- NULL\n\n# Option 2\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.treatment\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Categorical Predictors - Interpretation\n\n\nLet’s apply this to a different example - the iris dataset, and specifically, the Species categorical variable:\n\n#check what levels we have\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\n\n\nDummy Coding\nEffects Coding\n\n\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Species has 3 levels - “setosa”, “versicolor”, and “virginica”. If we put these into a model, assuming R’s default ordering, we know that R will automatically apply dummy (or treatment coding), and “setosa” will be taken as our reference group:\n\n#fit model\nspec_model &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6880 -0.3285 -0.0060  0.3120  1.3120 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

The estimated average sepal length for the species setosa was approximately 5.01.\nThe second estimate corresponds to Speciesversicolor and was \\(\\hat \\beta_1 = 0.93\\). The difference in mean sepal length between setosa and versicolor species was estimated to be \\(0.93~cm\\). Thus, \\(\\hat \\mu_2 = 5.01 + 0.93 = 5.94\\). We could say - the species iris versicolor had a sepal length of approximately 5.94cm, and this was approximately 0.93cm longer than the iris setosa. This difference was statistically significant \\((p &lt; .001)\\).\nThe third estimate corresponds to Speciesvirginica and was \\(\\hat \\beta_2 = 1.58\\). The difference in mean sepal length between setosa and virginica species was estimated to be \\(1.58~cm\\). Thus, \\(\\hat \\mu_2 = 5.01 + 1.58 = 6.59\\).

The difference in mean sepal length between setosa \\((\\hat \\mu_1)\\) and the grand mean \\((\\hat \\mu_0)\\) was estimated to be \\(0.84~cm\\).

Functions like fct_relevel() might be handy too.\nFor example, let’s say we wanted to change the reference level in our “spec_model” above, there are a few different ways that we can do this.\nFirst we should check the current ordering of the levels:\n\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\nWe can then change the reference level to be versicolor (using one of the below methods):\n\n\nfct_relevel()\nrelevel()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\niris &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Species = fct_relevel(Species, \"versicolor\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- relevel(iris$Species, \"versicolor\")\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- iris$Species %&gt;% \n  factor(., levels = c(\"versicolor\", \"setosa\", \"virginica\"))\n\n\n\n\nAnd then re-run our model:\n\n#fit model\nspec_model2 &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6880 -0.3285 -0.0060  0.3120  1.3120 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

Recall the formula for obtaining a confidence interval for the population slope is:\n\\[\n\\hat \\beta_j \\pm t^* \\cdot SE(\\hat \\beta_j)\n\\] where \\(t^*\\) denotes the critical value chosen from t-distribution with \\(n-k-1\\) degrees of freedom (where \\(k\\) = number of predictors and \\(n\\) = sample size) for a desired \\(\\alpha\\) level of confidence.\n\nIn R\nWe can obtain the confidence intervals for the regression coefficients using the command confint()\n\n\n\nThe t-statistic is the \\(\\beta\\) coefficient divided by the standard error:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\hat \\beta_j - 0}{SE(\\hat \\beta_j)}\n\\]\nwhich follows a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-k-1\\) degrees of freedom (where \\(k\\) = number of predictors and \\(n\\) = sample size).\nWith this, we can test the the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_j = 0\\).\nGenerally speaking, you want your model coefficients to have large \\(t\\)-statistics as this would indicate that the standard error was small in comparison to the coefficient. The larger our \\(t\\)-statistic, the more confident we can be that the coefficient is not 0.\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(t\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named mdl):\n\ncoef(summary(mdl))[, \"t value\"]\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,3]\n\n\n\n\nFrom our \\(t\\)-value, we can compute our \\(p\\)-value. The \\(p\\)-value help us to understand whether our coefficient(s) are statistically significant (i.e., that the coefficient is statistically different from 0). The \\(p\\)-value of each estimate indicates the probability of observing a \\(t\\)-value at least as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data when assuming the null hypothesis to be true.\nIn Psychology, a \\(p\\)-value &lt; .05 is usually used to make statements regarding statistical significance (it is important that you always state your \\(\\alpha\\) level to help your reader understand any statements regarding statistical significance).\nThe number of asterisks marks corresponds with the significance of the coefficient (see the ‘Signif. codes’ legend just under the coefficients section).\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(p\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named mdl):\n\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, model standard deviation of the errors highlighted\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation of the errors, denoted by \\(\\sigma\\), is an important quantity that our model estimates.

At the 5% significance level, there was evidence that iris sepal length was significantly different between Western and Eastern states in the US \\((t(147) = 14.09, p &lt; .001, \\text{two-sided})\\), and this difference was estimated to be 1.26cm. We are 95% confident that an Iris grown in an Eastern state, on average, would be between 1.08cm and 1.43cm longer than those grown in a Western state \\((CI_{95}[1.08, 1.43])\\)."

Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via mean(), standard deviation (via sd()), minimum value (via min()), maximum value (via max()), standard error (via se()), and skewness (via skew()).\n\n\nNumeric values only example:\nCategorical and numeric values example:\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\nM_Length\nSD_Length\n\n\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# grouping by Species.

In a population it is denoted by \\(\\rho\\), and in a sample it is denoted by \\(r\\).\nValues of \\(r\\) fall between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). How to interpret:\n\nSize: More extreme values (i.e., the The closer \\(r\\) is to \\(+/- 1\\)) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to \\(0\\) a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n\nWeak = \\(.1 &lt; |r| &lt; .3\\)\n\nModerate = \\(.3 &lt; |r| &lt; .5\\)\n\nStrong = \\(|r| &gt; .5\\)\n\n\n\nDirection: The sign of \\(r\\) says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n\nPositive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\nNegative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation Matrix\n\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients - \\(r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}\\) - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).\n\nIn R\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the cor() function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables must be numeric.\n\nLet’s check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe can see that the variable Species in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to subset, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside [], or using select(). In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\nIf you had NA values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these NAs using na.rm = TRUE inside the cor() function.\n\n\nIndex dataframe ([])\nVariable selection (select())\n\n\n\n\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) %&gt;%\n  cor() %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the population parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., \\(\\rho\\)).\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho = 0\\).

    "text": "Visual Exploration\nVisual exploration of our data allows us to visualize the distributions of our data, and to identify potential associations between variables.\n\n How to Visualise Data\n\n\nTo visualise (i.e., plot) our data, we can use ggplot() from the tidyverse package. Note the key components of the ggplot() code:\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the \\(x\\)-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n\n+ geom_... = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes().\n\nlabs() = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., bins =, alpha =, fill =, linewidth =. linetype =, size = etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using ? - e.g., ?fill\nIf you’d like to read more about ggplot(), there is a handy cheatsheet.\n\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:\n\nUse to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels\n\nThe patchwork package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - | arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and / arranges the plots on top of one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Marginal Examples\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nDensity\n\n\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width.\nBasic:\n\nx-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\ny-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n\nWhat are bins?: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bins:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify bins = to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can specify binwidth = to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify color = to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"red\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify fill = to fill the columns with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"purple\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visualization of the distribution of a numeric variable.\nBasic:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilled:\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying fill = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Type & Width:\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying linetype = and linewidth = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Bivariate Examples\n\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within aes(), to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis.\n\n\nScatterplot\nBoxplot\nFacets\n\n\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values.\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a cloud of scattered points.\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\n\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill points with color:\nWithin geom_point(), we can specify color = to fill the points with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"orange\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange size and opacity:\nWe can change the size (using size =) and the opacity (using alpha =) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a boxplot to visualise the association between one numeric variable and one categorical variable - these will be our y- and x-axis values respectively.\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_boxplot() to get a boxplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange boxplot fill colours by group:\nWithin aes(), we can specify fill = to fill the boxes with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange boxplot line colours by group:\nWithin aes(), we can specify color = to colour the lines with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding jitter:\nWe can add jittered points to a boxplot to better see the underlying distribution of the data (by adding a little random variation to each data point) via geom_jitter():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    geom_jitter() + \n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange legend position:\nWe can add the argument + theme(legend.position = ) to move (or even remove) the legend by specifying, for example, \"right\", \"left\", \"top\", \"bottom\", or \"none\" to remove.\n\n# legend at bottom of plot\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\") + \n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have two numeric variables, as well as categorical variables, we can use facet_wrap() / facet_grid() to help divide/arrange our plots. If we had two categorical variables, by simply stringing them together to further group our plots by specifying facet_wrap( ~ cat_variable1 + cat_variable2)\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot, and either + facet_wrap() or + facet_grid() to separate by your categorical variable:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(~Species) + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE. Note that a line is fitted for every level of your categorical variable:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n        facet_wrap(~Species) + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubplot layout:\nYou can change the overall layout of the subplots by specifying dir = within the facet_wrap() argument, where “h” will return a horizontal layout (this is the default) and “v” for vertical.\nYou can also change the layout of the subplot labels by specifying strip.position = within the facet_wrap() argument, where labels can be arranged to display at the “top” (this is the default), “bottom”, “left” or “right”.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(~Species, dir = \"v\", strip.position = \"right\") + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")"

You have been provided with data from twenty participants who studied passages of text (c500 words long), and were tested a week later. The testing phase presented participants with 100 statements about the text. They had to answer whether each statement was true or false, as well as rate their confidence in each answer (on a sliding scale from 0 to 100). The dataset contains, for each participant, the percentage of items correctly answered, their age (in years), and their average confidence rating.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/recalldata.csv\nWe could specify our model as:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall Accuracy}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\nand fit our model in R as\n\n#specify model\nrecall_simp &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n#look at model coefficients\nrecall_simp\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          age  \n    84.0153      -0.3026  \n\n\nWhen we call the name of the fitted model, recall_simp, you can see the estimated regression coefficients \\(\\hat \\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\). The line of best-fit is thus given by:1\n\\[\n\\widehat{Recall~Accuracy} = 84.02 - 0.31 \\cdot \\text{Age}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification\n\n\nMultiple linear regression involves looking at one continuous outcome (i.e., DV), with two or more independent variables (i.e., IVs).\nA multiple linear regression model takes the following form:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon_i\n\\] \\[\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\] So, for example, we could extend our recall accuracy model to include recall confidence as a predictor:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall Accuracy}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Recall Confidence}_i + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\n\nIn R:\nMultiple and simple linear regression follow the same structure within the lm() function - the logic scales up to however many predictor variables we want to include in our model. You simply add (using the + sign) more independent variables. For example, if we wanted to build a multiple linear regression that included three independent variables, we could fit one of the following via the lm() function:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV1 + data_name$IV2 + data_name$IV3)\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Multiple Regression Coefficients\nYou’ll hear a lot of different ways that people explain multiple regression coefficients.\nFor the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon\\), the estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) will often be reported as:\n“the increase in \\(y\\) for a one unit increase in \\(x_1\\) when…”\n\n“holding the effect of \\(x_2\\) constant.”\n“controlling for differences in \\(x_2\\).”\n“partialling out the effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n“holding \\(x_2\\) equal.”\n“accounting for effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n\nFor models with 3+ predictors, just like building the model in R, the logic of the above simply extends.\nFor example “the increase in [outcome] for a one unit increase in [predictor] when…”\n\n“holding [other predictors] constant.”\n\n“accounting for [other predictors].”\n\n“controlling for differences in [other predictors].”\n\n“partialling out the effects of [other predictors].”\n\n“holding [other predictors] equal.”\n\n“accounting for effects of [other predictors].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Simple Linear Regression Models - Visualisation\n\n\nAs we saw above, the line representing the relationship between side and perimeter of squares is able to predict the actual perimeter value from the measurement of the side of a square.\nThis is possible because the association between side and perimeter is an exact one. That is, any squares having the same side will have the same perimeter, and there will be no variation in those values.\nThe line that best fits the association between recall accuracy and age (see Figure 2), instead, is only able to predict the average accuracy for a given value of age.\nThis is because there will be a distribution of recall accuracy at each value of age. The line will fit the trend/pattern in the values, but there will be individual-to-individual variability that we must accept around that average pattern.\n\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + \n    labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", y = \"Recall Accuracy (%)\")\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Association between Recall Accuracy and Age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multiple Linear Regression Models - Visualisation\n\n\nWhen we have 2+ predictors, we can’t just plot our data an add geom_smooth(method=lm), because that would give a visualisation of a linear model with just one predictor (whichever one is on the x-axis).\nInstead, we can use the function plot_model() from sjPlot. Here’s an example with our recall accuracy model, with two predictors (recall confidence and age):\n\nplot_model(recall_mdl,\n           type = \"eff\",\n           terms = \"recall_confidence\",\n           show.data = TRUE)\n\nplot_model(recall_mdl,\n           type = \"eff\",\n           terms = \"age\",\n           show.data = TRUE)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Association between Recall Accuracy, Recall Confidence and Age\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Association between Recall Accuracy, Recall Confidence and Age"

    "text": "Numeric Outcomes & Categorical Predictors\n\n Overview\n\n\nWe can include categorical predictors in a linear regression, but the interpretation of the coefficients is very specific. Whereas we talked about coefficients being interpreted as “the change in \\(y\\) associated with a 1-unit increase in \\(x\\)”, for categorical explanatory variables, coefficients can be considered to examine differences in group means.\n\n\n\n\n\n Coding Variables as Factors\n\n\nWhen we have categorical predictors, it is important that we tell R specifically to code them appropriately as factors.\n\nIn R\nWe can use various functions to convert between different types of data, such as:\n\n\nfactor() / as_factor() - to turn a variable into a factor\n\n\nas.numeric() - to turn a variable into numbers\n\n\nAs a first step, it is a good idea to look at the structure of the dataset you are working with. For the purpose of this example, our dataset is called “tips” (you might recall this from DAPR1):\n\nstr(tips)\n\nspc_tbl_ [157 × 7] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: chr [1:157] \"n\" \"n\" \"y\" \"y\" ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   Bill = col_double(),\n  ..   Tip = col_double(),\n  ..   Credit = col_character(),\n  ..   Guests = col_double(),\n  ..   Day = col_character(),\n  ..   Server = col_character(),\n  ..   PctTip = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n\nFrom the output, we can see that Credit (whether guests paid with a credit card; n/y responses) was coded as a &lt;chr&gt; or character variable. If we wanted to set this as a factor so that R recognises it as a categorical variable, we can use on of the following:\n\n\nas_factor()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\ntips &lt;- tips %&gt;% \n  mutate(Credit = as_factor(Credit))\n\n\n\nWe could also use the factor() function, and at the same time label factors appropriately to aid reader interpretation (it may not be immediately clear to some that n represents ‘No’ and y represents ‘Yes’). To do so, we list the all levels of Credit, and provide a new label corresponding to each level:\n\ntips$Credit &lt;- factor(tips$Credit, \n                      levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                      labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n\n\n\n\nUsing either of the above approaches, if we now run str(tips) again, you should see that Credit is now coded as a factor with 2 levels:\n\nstr(tips)\n\ntibble [157 × 7] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: Factor w/ 2 levels \"n\",\"y\": 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Binary Predictors\n\n\nBinary variables have two categories (more commonly referred to as levels), and these levels (e.g., Yes/No, Dog/Cat, Right/Left, Smoker/Non-Smoker) are simply entered in the model as a series of 0s and 1s. Numeric variables that represent categorical data are typically referred to as dummy variables.\nOur coefficients are just the same as before. The intercept is where our predictor equals zero, and the slope is the change in our outcome variable associated with a 1-unit change in our predictor.\nHowever, “zero” for this predictor variable now corresponds to a whole level. This is known as the “reference level”. Accordingly, the 1-unit change in our predictor (the move from “zero” to “one”) corresponds to the difference between the two levels.\nWhen used as predictors in multiple regression models, binary variables behave much the same way. The coefficient will give us the estimated change in \\(y\\) when moving from one level to the other, whilst holding other predictors constant (for more info, see the Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification flashcard, specifically the section on interpretation of multiple regression coefficients).\n\n\n\n\n\n Categorical Predictors with k levels\n\n\nWhen we have a categorical explanatory variable with more than 2 levels, our model gets a bit more complex - it needs not just one, but a number of dummy variables. For a categorical variable with \\(k\\) levels, we can express it in \\(k-1\\) dummy variables.\nFor example, the “species” column below has three levels, and can be expressed by the two variables “species_dog” and “species_parrot”:\n\n\n  species species_dog species_parrot\n1     cat           0              0\n2     cat           0              0\n3     dog           1              0\n4  parrot           0              1\n5     dog           1              0\n6     cat           0              0\n7     ...         ...            ...\n\n\n\nThe “cat” level is expressed whenever both the “species_dog” and “species_parrot” variables are 0.\nThe “dog” level is expressed whenever the “species_dog” variable is 1 and the “species_parrot” variable is 0.\nThe “parrot” level is expressed whenever the “species_dog” variable is 0 and the “species_parrot” variable is 1.\n\nR will do all of this re-expression for us. If we include in our model a categorical explanatory variable with 3 different levels, the model will estimate 2 parameters - one for each dummy variable. We can interpret the parameter estimates (the coefficients we obtain using coefficients(),coef() or summary()) as the estimated increase in the outcome variable associated with an increase of one in each dummy variable (holding all other variables equal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt value\nPr(&gt;|t|)\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n60.28\n1.209\n49.86\n5.273e-39\n\n\nspeciesdog\n-11.47\n1.71\n-6.708\n3.806e-08\n\n\nspeciesparrot\n-4.916\n1.71\n-2.875\n0.006319\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the intercept is the estimated outcome when all predictors are zero. In our example then, this represents the cat. We think of the “cat” category in this example as the reference level - it is the category against which other categories are compared against. Therefore, in the above example, an increase in 1 of “species_dog” is the difference between a “cat” and a “dog”. An increase in one of “species_parrot” is the difference between a “cat” and a “parrot”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dummy vs Effects Coding\n\n\nPossible side-constraints on the parameters are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nConstraint\nMeaning of \\(\\beta_0\\)\n\nR\n\n\n\nSum to zero (Effects Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu\\)\ncontr.sum\n\n\nReference group (Dummy Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu_1\\)\ncontr.treatment\n\n\n\nDummy Coding\nBy default R uses the reference group constraint - i.e., dummy coding (sometimes called treatment contrast coding). If your factor has \\(g\\) levels, your regression model will have \\(g-1\\) dummy variables (R creates them for you, as we’ve seen in the examples above).\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated \\(y\\) when all predictors (i.e., \\(x\\)’s) are zero. Because the reference level is kind of like “0” in our contrast matrix, this is part of the intercept estimate. We get out a coefficient for each subsequent level, which are the estimated differences from each level to the reference group.\nEffects Coding\nEffects coding (sometimes called sum-to-zero coding) is the next most commonly used in psychological research. These are a way of comparing each level to the overall (or grand) mean. This involves a bit of trickery that uses -1s and 1s rather than 0s and 1s, in order to make “0” be mid-way between all the levels - the average of the levels.\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated average \\(y\\) when averaged across all levels of the predictor variable. In other words, it is the estimated grand mean of \\(y\\). The coefficients represent the estimated difference for that level from the overall grand mean.\n\nIn R\nIf we want to use effects coding, we can apply:\n\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.sum\"\n\nWe can switch back to the default reference group constraint by applying either of these:\n\n# Option 1\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- NULL\n\n# Option 2\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.treatment\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Categorical Predictors - Interpretation\n\n\nLet’s apply this to a different example - the iris dataset, and specifically, the Species categorical variable:\n\n#check what levels we have\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\n\n\nDummy Coding\nEffects Coding\n\n\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Species has 3 levels - “setosa”, “versicolor”, and “virginica”. If we put these into a model, assuming R’s default ordering, we know that R will automatically apply dummy (or treatment coding), and “setosa” will be taken as our reference group:\n\n#fit model\nspec_model &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6880 -0.3285 -0.0060  0.3120  1.3120 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

The difference in mean sepal length between setosa \\((\\hat \\mu_1)\\) and the grand mean \\((\\hat \\mu_0)\\) was estimated to be \\(0.84~cm\\). In other words, the iris species of setosa had a sepal length \\(0.84~cm\\) shorter than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 + (-0.83733) = 5~cm\\). This difference in length was statistically significant \\((p &lt; .001)\\).\nThe third estimate corresponds to Species2 and was \\(\\hat \\beta_2 = 0.09\\). The difference in mean sepal length between versicolor \\((\\hat \\mu_2)\\) and the grand mean \\((\\hat \\mu_0)\\) was estimated to be \\(0.09~cm\\). In other words, the iris species of versicolor had a sepal length \\(0.09~cm\\) longer than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 + 0.09267 = 5.94~cm\\). This difference in length was not statistically significant \\((p = .121)\\).\nThe estimate for Species3, representing the difference of “virginica” to the grand mean is not shown by summary(). Because of the side-constraint, we know that \\(\\mu_3 = \\beta_0 - (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2)\\). The difference in sepal length between virginica and the grand mean was estimated to be \\(-(-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 0.74466\\). In other words, the virginica iris species had a sepal length \\(0.74~cm\\) longer than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 - (-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 6.59~cm\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Specifying Reference Levels\n\n\nWhen you have a categorical variable coded as a factor, R will default to using alphabetical ordering - hence in our example above “cat” was the reference level (as opposed to “dog” or “parrot”), and in the other “setosa” was the reference level (as opposed to “versicolor” or “virginica”).\nWe could override this by making it a factor with an ordering to it’s levels (see the use of factor() and levels()). Functions like fct_relevel() might be handy too.\nFor example, let’s say we wanted to change the reference level in our “spec_model” above, there are a few different ways that we can do this.\nFirst we should check the current ordering of the levels:\n\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\nWe can then change the reference level to be versicolor (using one of the below methods):\n\n\nfct_relevel()\nrelevel()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\niris &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Species = fct_relevel(Species, \"versicolor\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- relevel(iris$Species, \"versicolor\")\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- iris$Species %&gt;% \n  factor(., levels = c(\"versicolor\", \"setosa\", \"virginica\"))\n\n\n\n\nAnd then re-run our model:\n\n#fit model\nspec_model2 &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6880 -0.3285 -0.0060  0.3120  1.3120 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

    "text": "Interaction Models\n\n Specifying Interaction Models\n\n\nInteraction models allow us to model the idea of “the association between \\(x_1\\) and \\(y\\) differs depending on the level of \\(x_2\\)” by including a product (multiplication) term between the two predictors.\nFormula:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 (x_1 \\cdot x_2) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nIf we fit the interaction x1:x2, we almost always want to also fit the separate effects x1 and x2:\n\n“Except in special circumstances, a model including a product term for interaction between two explanatory variables should also include terms with each of the explanatory variables individually, even though their coefficients may not be significantly different from zero. Following this rule avoids the logical inconsistency of saying that the effect of \\(X_1\\) depends on the level of \\(X_2\\) but that there is no effect of \\(X_1\\).”\n— Ramsey and Schafer (2012)\n\n\nIn R:\nThere are basically two pieces of information that we need to pass to the lm() function:\n\nThe formula: The regression formula should be specified in the form y ~ x where \\(y\\) is the dependent variable (DV), \\(x_1\\) the first independent variable (IV1), and \\(x_2\\) the second independent variable (IV2). We then also need to include the interaction term between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\nThe data: Specify which dataframe (data =) contains the variables specified in the formula.\n\n\nrun interaction model via lm() function\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1*IV2, data = data_name)\n\nOR\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV1:IV2, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interpreting Coefficients\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting coefficients for A and B in the presence of an interaction A:B\nInterpreting the interaction term A:B\n\n\n\nWhen you include an interaction between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in a regression model, you are estimating the extent to which the effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) is different across the values of \\(x_2\\).\nWhat this means is that the effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) depends on/is conditional upon the value of \\(x_2\\) (and vice versa, the effect of \\(x_2\\) on \\(y\\) is different across the values of \\(x_1\\)).\nThis means that we can no longer talk about the “effect of \\(x_1\\) holding \\(x_2\\) constant”. Instead we can talk about a marginal effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) at a specific value of \\(x_2\\).\n\nWhen we fit the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 (x_1 \\cdot x_2) + \\epsilon\\) using lm():\n\nthe parameter estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) is the marginal effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) where \\(x_2 = 0\\)\n\nthe parameter estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_2\\) is the marginal effect of \\(x_2\\) on \\(y\\) where \\(x_1 = 0\\) In other words, when we fit a model with an interaction in R, we get out coefficients for both predictors, and for the interaction. The coefficients for each individual predictor reflect the effect on the outcome when the other predictor is zero.\n\n\n\n N.B. Regardless of whether or not there is an interaction term in our model, all parameter estimates in multiple regression are “conditional” in the sense that they are dependent upon the inclusion of other variables in the model. For instance, in \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon\\) the coefficient \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) is conditional upon holding \\(x_2\\) constant. \n\n\n\nThe coefficient for an interaction term can be thought of as providing an adjustment to the slope.\nLet’s take the following model as an example:\nlm(formula = y ~ x1 * x2, data = df)\n...\n\n...\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

For variables that aren’t involved in the interaction term, these are still held constant.\nFor example, suppose we also had another predictor \\(c_1\\) in our model:\nlm(y ~ c1 + x1 + x2 + x1:x2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\nthe estimated \\(y\\) when all predictors (\\(c_1\\), \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)) are zero is [estimate]\n\n\nc1\na 1 unit increase in \\(c_1\\) is associated with a [estimate] increase in \\(y\\), holding constant all other variables in the model (\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\))\n\n\nx1\nholding \\(c_1\\) constant, when \\(x_2\\) is zero, a 1 unit increase in \\(x_1\\) is associated with a [estimate] change in \\(y\\)\n\n\n\nx2\nholding \\(c_1\\) constant, when \\(x_1\\) is zero, a 1 unit increase in \\(x_2\\) is associated with a [estimate] change in \\(y\\).\n\n\nx1:x2\nholding \\(c_1\\) constant, as \\(x_2\\) increases by 1, the association between \\(x_1\\) and \\(y\\) changes by [estimate]orholding \\(c_1\\) constant, as \\(x_1\\) increases by 1, the association between \\(x_2\\) and \\(y\\) changes by [estimate]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example Data\n\n\nFor the examples in this section , we are going to use the palmer penguins dataset2.

In this specific example, there is no natural reference category, nor one that maps to our RQ, so we will go with R’s default coding and have Adelie as our reference group for species. \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Body Mass} ~=~ & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Flipper Length} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Chinstrap} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Gentoo} \\\\\n& + \\beta_4 \\cdot (\\text{Flipper Length} \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Chinstrap}) \\\\\n& + \\beta_5 \\cdot (\\text{Flipper Length} \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Gentoo}) + \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\quad\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n Model Building\n\n\nNo penguins in our dataset had a flipper length of zero mm. We might want to mean centre this predictor variable so that we can consider the difference in body mass between penguin species with average flipper lengths. Before we build our model, we should mean centre this IV:\n\npenguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n   mc_flipper_length_mm = scale(flipper_length_mm, scale = FALSE)\n   )\n\nRecall that the default in R is to apply dummy coding, and thus R computes the dummy variables for us! Since we are using the default reference group, we can simply run our model (with our newly created mean centered flipper length variable):\n\nmdl_nc &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ mc_flipper_length_mm * species, data = penguins)\n\nEach row in the summary() output of the model will correspond to one of the estimated \\(\\beta\\)’s in the equation above.\n\nsummary(mdl_nc)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ mc_flipper_length_mm * species, data = penguins)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-911.18 -251.93  -31.77  197.82 1144.81 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                      Estimate Std.

Here we need to specify the model object, what we want on the x- and y-axis, and whether we want 95% CIs to be displayed.\n\nIn R\n\n## first argument is the model object we need to use to visualise the slopes\n## species is on the x axis\n## separate lines for each level of sex\n## return 95% CIs is set to true (default is false)\n\nemmip(mdl_cc, sex ~ species,\n      CIs = TRUE,\n      ylab = \"Predicted Weight (g)\",\n      xlab = \"Species\")\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Predicted Penguin Weight by Species and Sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nA simple effects analysis examined the whether there was a difference in body mass between male and female chinstrap penguins.

Recall the formula for obtaining a confidence interval for the population slope is:\n\\[\n\\hat \\beta_j \\pm t^* \\cdot SE(\\hat \\beta_j)\n\\] where \\(t^*\\) denotes the critical value chosen from t-distribution with \\(n-k-1\\) degrees of freedom (where \\(k\\) = number of predictors and \\(n\\) = sample size) for a desired \\(\\alpha\\) level of confidence.\n\nIn R\nWe can obtain the confidence intervals for the regression coefficients using the command confint()\n\n\n\nThe t-statistic is the \\(\\beta\\) coefficient divided by the standard error:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\hat \\beta_j - 0}{SE(\\hat \\beta_j)}\n\\]\nwhich follows a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-k-1\\) degrees of freedom (where \\(k\\) = number of predictors and \\(n\\) = sample size).\nWith this, we can test the the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_j = 0\\).\nGenerally speaking, you want your model coefficients to have large \\(t\\)-statistics as this would indicate that the standard error was small in comparison to the coefficient. The larger our \\(t\\)-statistic, the more confident we can be that the coefficient is not 0.\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(t\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named mdl):\n\ncoef(summary(mdl))[, \"t value\"]\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,3]\n\n\n\n\nFrom our \\(t\\)-value, we can compute our \\(p\\)-value. The \\(p\\)-value help us to understand whether our coefficient(s) are statistically significant (i.e., that the coefficient is statistically different from 0). The \\(p\\)-value of each estimate indicates the probability of observing a \\(t\\)-value at least as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data when assuming the null hypothesis to be true.\nIn Psychology, a \\(p\\)-value &lt; .05 is usually used to make statements regarding statistical significance (it is important that you always state your \\(\\alpha\\) level to help your reader understand any statements regarding statistical significance).\nThe number of asterisks marks corresponds with the significance of the coefficient (see the ‘Signif. codes’ legend just under the coefficients section).\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(p\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named mdl):\n\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, model standard deviation of the errors highlighted\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation of the errors, denoted by \\(\\sigma\\), is an important quantity that our model estimates.

    "text": "Multiple Comparisons\n\n Pairwise Comparisons\n\n\nWe can use pairwise comparisons when we want to compare all levels of an independent variable with all the levels of the other. In other words, we can compare all pairwise means between groups to determine whether there is a statistical difference between each pair of groups compared.\nFor example, let’s say that you had 2 categorical variables - Day (5 levels: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, and Fri) and Time (3 levels: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) where your outcome variable was productivity level (scored on a scale 0-50). If we were to conduct all possible pairwise comparisons, this would lead to the following pairs of groups being compared on productivity:\n\nMon - Morning\n\nMon - Afternoon\n\nMon - Evening\n\nTue - Morning\n\nTue - Afternoon\n\nTue - Evening\n\nWed - Morning\n\nWed - Afternoon\n\nWed - Evening\n\nThurs - Morning\n\nThurs - Afternoon\n\nThurs - Evening\n\nFri - Morning\n\nFri - Afternoon\n\nFri - Evening\n\n\nIn R\n\n#run comparisons\npair_comp &lt;- pairs(&lt;INSERT OBJECT NAME&gt;)\n\n#examine output\npair_comp\n\n#plot comparisons\nplot(pair_comp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why does the Number of Tests Matter?\n\n\nIf we are conducting all possible pairwise comparisons, we can calculate how many tests are being conducted via the following rule:\n\\[\n_nC_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\\\\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{align} \\\\\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& n = \\text{total number in the set} \\\\\n& r = \\text{number chosen} \\\\\n& _nC_r = \\text{number of combinations of r from n} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, why does the number of tests matter? First, think back to “Type 1 errors” from DAPR1 - when we conduct an hypothesis test, and we set \\(\\alpha = .05\\), we will reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) when we find a \\(p &lt; .05\\). Now remember what a \\(p\\)-value represents - it is the chance of observing a statistic at least as extreme as the one we do have, assuming the null hypothesis to be true. This means that if \\(H_0\\) is true, then we will still observe a \\(p &lt; .05\\) 5% of the time. So our chance of making this error = the threshold (\\(\\alpha\\)) at which below a \\(p\\)-value results in us rejecting \\(H_0\\).\nBut this error-rate applies to each statistical hypothesis we test. So if we conduct an experiment in which we plan on conducting lots of tests of different comparisons, the chance of an error being made increases substantially. Across the family of tests performed that chance will be much higher than 5%.3\nEach test conducted at \\(\\alpha = .05\\) has a .05 (or 5%) probability of Type I error (wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis). If we do 9 tests, that experiment-wise error rate is \\(\\alpha_{ew} \\leq 9 \\times .05\\), where 9 is the number of comparisons made as part of the experiment.\nThus, if nine independent comparisons were made at the \\(\\alpha = .05\\) level, the experiment-wise Type I error rate \\(\\alpha_{ew}\\) would be at most \\(9 \\times .05 = 0.45\\). That is, we could wrongly reject the null hypothesis on average 45 times out of 100.\nTo make this more confusing, many of the tests in a family are not independent (see the lecture slides for the calculation of error rate for dependent tests).\n\n\n\n\n\n When to use Which Correction\n\n\nBonferroni\n\nUse Bonferroni’s method when you are interested in a small number of planned contrasts (or pairwise comparisons).\nBonferroni’s method is to divide alpha by the number of tests/confidence intervals.\nAssumes that all comparisons are independent of one another.\n\nIt sacrifices slightly more power than Tukey’s method (discussed below), but it can be applied to any set of contrasts or linear combinations (i.e., it is useful in more situations than Tukey).\nIt is usually better than Tukey if we want to do a small number of planned comparisons.\n\nŠídák\n\n(A bit) more powerful than the Bonferroni method.\nAssumes that all comparisons are independent of one another.\nLess common than Bonferroni method, largely because it is more difficult to calculate (not a problem now we have computers).\n\nTukey\n\nIt specifies an exact family significance level for comparing all pairs of treatment means.\n\nUse Tukey’s method when you are interested in all (or most) pairwise comparisons of means.\n\nScheffe\n\nIt is the most conservative (least powerful) of all tests.\nIt controls the family alpha level for testing all possible contrasts.\nIt should be used if you have not planned contrasts in advance.\nFor testing pairs of treatment means it is too conservative (you should use Bonferroni or Šídák).\n\nOthers\n\nIn the wider literature, Holm’s step-down and Hochberg’s step-up mentioned. Do feel free to read about these in your spare time - there are lots of resources online.\n\n\nIn R\nYou can easily change which correction you are using via the adjust = argument.

    "text": "Numeric Exploration\nNumeric exploration of data involves examining key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation via descriptives tables; and assessing the associations among variables through correlation coefficients. Exploring our data numerically helps us to identify patterns and associations in the data.\nDescriptives\n\n Descriptives Tables\n\n\nThere are numerous packages available that allow us to pull out descriptive statistics from our dataset such as tidyverse and psych.\nWhen we pull out descriptive statistics, it is useful to present these in a well formatted table for your reader. There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the kable() function from the package kableExtra.\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via caption = \"insert caption here\", align values within columns e.g., center aligned via align = \"??\"), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via digits = ??).\nWe can also add in the function kable_styling(). This is really helpful for customising your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!).\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp\n\n\n\n\n\n Descriptives Tables - Examples\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse way\nThe psych way\n\n\n\nWe can use the summarise() function to numerically summarise/describe our data.

In a population it is denoted by \\(\\rho\\), and in a sample it is denoted by \\(r\\).\nValues of \\(r\\) fall between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). How to interpret:\n\nSize: More extreme values (i.e., the The closer \\(r\\) is to \\(+/- 1\\)) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to \\(0\\) a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n\nWeak = \\(.1 &lt; |r| &lt; .3\\)\n\nModerate = \\(.3 &lt; |r| &lt; .5\\)\n\nStrong = \\(|r| &gt; .5\\)\n\n\n\nDirection: The sign of \\(r\\) says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n\nPositive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\nNegative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation Matrix\n\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients - \\(r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}\\) - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).\n\nIn R\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the cor() function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables must be numeric.\n\nLet’s check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe can see that the variable Species in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to subset, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside [], or using select(). In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\nIf you had NA values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these NAs using na.rm = TRUE inside the cor() function.\n\n\nIndex dataframe ([])\nVariable selection (select())\n\n\n\n\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) %&gt;%\n  cor() %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the population parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., \\(\\rho\\)).\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho = 0\\).

    "text": "Visual Exploration\nVisual exploration of our data allows us to visualize the distributions of our data, and to identify potential associations between variables.\n\n How to Visualise Data\n\n\nTo visualise (i.e., plot) our data, we can use ggplot() from the tidyverse package. Note the key components of the ggplot() code:\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the \\(x\\)-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n\n+ geom_... = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes().\n\nlabs() = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., bins =, alpha =, fill =, linewidth =. linetype =, size = etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using ? - e.g., ?fill\nIf you’d like to read more about ggplot(), there is a handy cheatsheet.\n\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:\n\nUse to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels\n\nThe patchwork package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - | arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and / arranges the plots on top of one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Marginal Examples\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nDensity\n\n\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width.\nBasic:\n\nx-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\ny-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n\nWhat are bins?: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bins:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify bins = to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can specify binwidth = to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify color = to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"red\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify fill = to fill the columns with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"purple\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visualization of the distribution of a numeric variable.\nBasic:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilled:\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying fill = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Type & Width:\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying linetype = and linewidth = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Bivariate Examples\n\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within aes(), to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis.\n\n\nScatterplot\nBoxplot\nFacets\n\n\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values.\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a cloud of scattered points.\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\n\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill points with color:\nWithin geom_point(), we can specify color = to fill the points with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"orange\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange size and opacity:\nWe can change the size (using size =) and the opacity (using alpha =) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a boxplot to visualise the association between one numeric variable and one categorical variable - these will be our y- and x-axis values respectively.\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_boxplot() to get a boxplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange boxplot fill colours by group:\nWithin aes(), we can specify fill = to fill the boxes with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange boxplot line colours by group:\nWithin aes(), we can specify color = to colour the lines with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding jitter:\nWe can add jittered points to a boxplot to better see the underlying distribution of the data (by adding a little random variation to each data point) via geom_jitter():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    geom_jitter() + \n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange legend position:\nWe can add the argument + theme(legend.position = ) to move (or even remove) the legend by specifying, for example, \"right\", \"left\", \"top\", \"bottom\", or \"none\" to remove.\n\n# legend at bottom of plot\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\") + \n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have two numeric variables, as well as categorical variables, we can use facet_wrap() / facet_grid() to help divide/arrange our plots. If we had two categorical variables, by simply stringing them together to further group our plots by specifying facet_wrap( ~ cat_variable1 + cat_variable2)\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot, and either + facet_wrap() or + facet_grid() to separate by your categorical variable:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(~Species) + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE. Note that a line is fitted for every level of your categorical variable:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n        facet_wrap(~Species) + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubplot layout:\nYou can change the overall layout of the subplots by specifying dir = within the facet_wrap() argument, where “h” will return a horizontal layout (this is the default) and “v” for vertical.\nYou can also change the layout of the subplot labels by specifying strip.position = within the facet_wrap() argument, where labels can be arranged to display at the “top” (this is the default), “bottom”, “left” or “right”.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(~Species, dir = \"v\", strip.position = \"right\") + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")"

    "text": "Numeric Outcomes & Predictors\n\n Simple Linear Regression Models - Example\n\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether there was an association between recall accuracy and age. You have been provided with data from twenty participants who studied passages of text (c500 words long), and were tested a week later. The testing phase presented participants with 100 statements about the text. They had to answer whether each statement was true or false, as well as rate their confidence in each answer (on a sliding scale from 0 to 100). The dataset contains, for each participant, the percentage of items correctly answered, their age (in years), and their average confidence rating.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/recalldata.csv\nWe could specify our model as:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall Accuracy}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\nand fit our model in R as\n\n#specify model\nrecall_simp &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n#look at model coefficients\nrecall_simp\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          age  \n    84.0153      -0.3026  \n\n\nWhen we call the name of the fitted model, recall_simp, you can see the estimated regression coefficients \\(\\hat \\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\). The line of best-fit is thus given by:1\n\\[\n\\widehat{Recall~Accuracy} = 84.02 - 0.31 \\cdot \\text{Age}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification\n\n\nMultiple linear regression involves looking at one continuous outcome (i.e., DV), with two or more independent variables (i.e., IVs).\nA multiple linear regression model takes the following form:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon_i\n\\] \\[\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\] So, for example, we could extend our recall accuracy model to include recall confidence as a predictor:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall Accuracy}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Recall Confidence}_i + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\n\nIn R\nMultiple and simple linear regression follow the same structure within the lm() function - the logic scales up to however many predictor variables we want to include in our model. You simply add (using the + sign) more independent variables. For example, if we wanted to build a multiple linear regression that included three independent variables, we could fit one of the following via the lm() function:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV1 + data_name$IV2 + data_name$IV3)\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Multiple Regression Coefficients\nYou’ll hear a lot of different ways that people explain multiple regression coefficients.\nFor the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon\\), the estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) will often be reported as:\n“the increase in \\(y\\) for a one unit increase in \\(x_1\\) when…”\n\n“holding the effect of \\(x_2\\) constant.”\n“controlling for differences in \\(x_2\\).”\n“partialling out the effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n“holding \\(x_2\\) equal.”\n“accounting for effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n\nFor models with 3+ predictors, just like building the model in R, the logic of the above simply extends.\nFor example “the increase in [outcome] for a one unit increase in [predictor] when…”\n\n“holding [other predictors] constant.”\n\n“accounting for [other predictors].”\n\n“controlling for differences in [other predictors].”\n\n“partialling out the effects of [other predictors].”\n\n“holding [other predictors] equal.”\n\n“accounting for effects of [other predictors].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Simple Linear Regression Models - Visualisation\n\n\nAs we saw above, the line representing the relationship between side and perimeter of squares is able to predict the actual perimeter value from the measurement of the side of a square.\nThis is possible because the association between side and perimeter is an exact one. That is, any squares having the same side will have the same perimeter, and there will be no variation in those values.\nThe line that best fits the association between recall accuracy and age (see Figure 2), instead, is only able to predict the average accuracy for a given value of age.\nThis is because there will be a distribution of recall accuracy at each value of age. The line will fit the trend/pattern in the values, but there will be individual-to-individual variability that we must accept around that average pattern.\n\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + \n    labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", y = \"Recall Accuracy (%)\")\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Association between Recall Accuracy and Age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multiple Linear Regression Models - Visualisation\n\n\nWhen we have 2+ predictors, we can’t just plot our data an add geom_smooth(method=lm), because that would give a visualisation of a linear model with just one predictor (whichever one is on the x-axis).\nInstead, we can use the function plot_model() from sjPlot. Here’s an example with our recall accuracy model, with two predictors (recall confidence and age):\n\nplot_model(recall_mdl,\n           type = \"eff\",\n           terms = \"recall_confidence\",\n           show.data = TRUE)\n\nplot_model(recall_mdl,\n           type = \"eff\",\n           terms = \"age\",\n           show.data = TRUE)\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Association between Recall Accuracy, Recall Confidence and Age\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Association between Recall Accuracy, Recall Confidence and Age"

    "text": "Numeric Outcomes & Categorical Predictors\n\n Overview\n\n\nWe can include categorical predictors in a linear regression, but the interpretation of the coefficients is very specific. Whereas we talked about coefficients being interpreted as “the change in \\(y\\) associated with a 1-unit increase in \\(x\\)”, for categorical explanatory variables, coefficients can be considered to examine differences in group means.\n\n\n\n\n\n Coding Variables as Factors\n\n\nWhen we have categorical predictors, it is important that we tell R specifically to code them appropriately as factors.\n\nIn R\nWe can use various functions to convert between different types of data, such as:\n\n\nfactor() / as_factor() - to turn a variable into a factor\n\n\nas.numeric() - to turn a variable into numbers\n\n\nAs a first step, it is a good idea to look at the structure of the dataset you are working with. For the purpose of this example, our dataset is called “tips” (you might recall this from DAPR1):\n\nstr(tips)\n\nspc_tbl_ [157 × 7] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: chr [1:157] \"n\" \"n\" \"y\" \"y\" ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   Bill = col_double(),\n  ..   Tip = col_double(),\n  ..   Credit = col_character(),\n  ..   Guests = col_double(),\n  ..   Day = col_character(),\n  ..   Server = col_character(),\n  ..   PctTip = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n\nFrom the output, we can see that Credit (whether guests paid with a credit card; n/y responses) was coded as a &lt;chr&gt; or character variable. If we wanted to set this as a factor so that R recognises it as a categorical variable, we can use on of the following:\n\n\nas_factor()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\ntips &lt;- tips %&gt;% \n  mutate(Credit = as_factor(Credit))\n\n\n\nWe could also use the factor() function, and at the same time label factors appropriately to aid reader interpretation (it may not be immediately clear to some that n represents ‘No’ and y represents ‘Yes’). To do so, we list the all levels of Credit, and provide a new label corresponding to each level:\n\ntips$Credit &lt;- factor(tips$Credit, \n                      levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                      labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n\n\n\n\nUsing either of the above approaches, if we now run str(tips) again, you should see that Credit is now coded as a factor with 2 levels:\n\nstr(tips)\n\ntibble [157 × 7] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: Factor w/ 2 levels \"n\",\"y\": 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Binary Predictors\n\n\nBinary variables have two categories (more commonly referred to as levels), and these levels (e.g., Yes/No, Dog/Cat, Right/Left, Smoker/Non-Smoker) are simply entered in the model as a series of 0s and 1s. Numeric variables that represent categorical data are typically referred to as dummy variables.\nOur coefficients are just the same as before. The intercept is where our predictor equals zero, and the slope is the change in our outcome variable associated with a 1-unit change in our predictor.\nHowever, “zero” for this predictor variable now corresponds to a whole level. This is known as the “reference level”. Accordingly, the 1-unit change in our predictor (the move from “zero” to “one”) corresponds to the difference between the two levels.\nWhen used as predictors in multiple regression models, binary variables behave much the same way. The coefficient will give us the estimated change in \\(y\\) when moving from one level to the other, whilst holding other predictors constant (for more info, see the Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification flashcard, specifically the section on interpretation of multiple regression coefficients).\n\n\n\n\n\n Categorical Predictors with k levels\n\n\nWhen we have a categorical explanatory variable with more than 2 levels, our model gets a bit more complex - it needs not just one, but a number of dummy variables. For a categorical variable with \\(k\\) levels, we can express it in \\(k-1\\) dummy variables.\nFor example, the “species” column below has three levels, and can be expressed by the two variables “species_dog” and “species_parrot”:\n\n\n  species species_dog species_parrot\n1     cat           0              0\n2     cat           0              0\n3     dog           1              0\n4  parrot           0              1\n5     dog           1              0\n6     cat           0              0\n7     ...         ...            ...\n\n\n\nThe “cat” level is expressed whenever both the “species_dog” and “species_parrot” variables are 0.\nThe “dog” level is expressed whenever the “species_dog” variable is 1 and the “species_parrot” variable is 0.\nThe “parrot” level is expressed whenever the “species_dog” variable is 0 and the “species_parrot” variable is 1.\n\nR will do all of this re-expression for us. If we include in our model a categorical explanatory variable with 3 different levels, the model will estimate 2 parameters - one for each dummy variable. We can interpret the parameter estimates (the coefficients we obtain using coefficients(),coef() or summary()) as the estimated increase in the outcome variable associated with an increase of one in each dummy variable (holding all other variables equal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt value\nPr(&gt;|t|)\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n60.28\n1.209\n49.86\n5.273e-39\n\n\nspeciesdog\n-11.47\n1.71\n-6.708\n3.806e-08\n\n\nspeciesparrot\n-4.916\n1.71\n-2.875\n0.006319\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the intercept is the estimated outcome when all predictors are zero. In our example then, this represents the cat. We think of the “cat” category in this example as the reference level - it is the category against which other categories are compared against. Therefore, in the above example, an increase in 1 of “species_dog” is the difference between a “cat” and a “dog”. An increase in one of “species_parrot” is the difference between a “cat” and a “parrot”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dummy vs Effects Coding\n\n\nPossible side-constraints on the parameters are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nConstraint\nMeaning of \\(\\beta_0\\)\n\nR\n\n\n\nSum to zero (Effects Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu\\)\ncontr.sum\n\n\nReference group (Dummy Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu_1\\)\ncontr.treatment\n\n\n\nDummy Coding\nBy default R uses the reference group constraint - i.e., dummy coding (sometimes called treatment contrast coding). If your factor has \\(g\\) levels, your regression model will have \\(g-1\\) dummy variables (R creates them for you, as we’ve seen in the examples above).\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated \\(y\\) when all predictors (i.e., \\(x\\)’s) are zero. Because the reference level is kind of like “0” in our contrast matrix, this is part of the intercept estimate. We get out a coefficient for each subsequent level, which are the estimated differences from each level to the reference group.\nEffects Coding\nEffects coding (sometimes called sum-to-zero coding) is the next most commonly used in psychological research. These are a way of comparing each level to the overall (or grand) mean. This involves a bit of trickery that uses -1s and 1s rather than 0s and 1s, in order to make “0” be mid-way between all the levels - the average of the levels.\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated average \\(y\\) when averaged across all levels of the predictor variable. In other words, it is the estimated grand mean of \\(y\\). The coefficients represent the estimated difference for that level from the overall grand mean.\n\nIn R\nIf we want to use effects coding, we can apply:\n\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.sum\"\n\nWe can switch back to the default reference group constraint by applying either of these:\n\n# Option 1\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- NULL\n\n# Option 2\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.treatment\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Categorical Predictors - Interpretation\n\n\nLet’s apply this to a different example - the iris dataset, and specifically, the Species categorical variable:\n\n#check what levels we have\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\n\n\nDummy Coding\nEffects Coding\n\n\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Species has 3 levels - “setosa”, “versicolor”, and “virginica”. If we put these into a model, assuming R’s default ordering, we know that R will automatically apply dummy (or treatment coding), and “setosa” will be taken as our reference group:\n\n#fit model\nspec_model &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6880 -0.3285 -0.0060  0.3120  1.3120 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

In other words, the iris species of setosa had a sepal length \\(0.84~cm\\) shorter than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 + (-0.83733) = 5~cm\\). This difference in length was statistically significant \\((p &lt; .001)\\).\nThe third estimate corresponds to Species2 and was \\(\\hat \\beta_2 = 0.09\\). The difference in mean sepal length between versicolor \\((\\hat \\mu_2)\\) and the grand mean \\((\\hat \\mu_0)\\) was estimated to be \\(0.09~cm\\).

This difference in length was not statistically significant \\((p = .121)\\).\nThe estimate for Species3, representing the difference of “virginica” to the grand mean is not shown by summary(). Because of the side-constraint, we know that \\(\\mu_3 = \\beta_0 - (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2)\\). The difference in sepal length between virginica and the grand mean was estimated to be \\(-(-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 0.74466\\). In other words, the virginica iris species had a sepal length \\(0.74~cm\\) longer than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 - (-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 6.59~cm\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Specifying Reference Levels\n\n\nWhen you have a categorical variable coded as a factor, R will default to using alphabetical ordering - hence in our example above “cat” was the reference level (as opposed to “dog” or “parrot”), and in the other “setosa” was the reference level (as opposed to “versicolor” or “virginica”).\nWe could override this by making it a factor with an ordering to it’s levels (see the use of factor() and levels()). Functions like fct_relevel() might be handy too.\nFor example, let’s say we wanted to change the reference level in our “spec_model” above, there are a few different ways that we can do this.\nFirst we should check the current ordering of the levels:\n\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\nWe can then change the reference level to be versicolor (using one of the below methods):\n\n\nfct_relevel()\nrelevel()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\niris &lt;- iris %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Species = fct_relevel(Species, \"versicolor\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- relevel(iris$Species, \"versicolor\")\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- iris$Species %&gt;% \n  factor(., levels = c(\"versicolor\", \"setosa\", \"virginica\"))\n\n\n\n\nAnd then re-run our model:\n\n#fit model\nspec_model2 &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6880 -0.3285 -0.0060  0.3120  1.3120 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

Following this rule avoids the logical inconsistency of saying that the effect of \\(X_1\\) depends on the level of \\(X_2\\) but that there is no effect of \\(X_1\\).”\n— Ramsey and Schafer (2012)\n\n\nIn R\nThere are basically two pieces of information that we need to pass to the lm() function:\n\nThe formula: The regression formula should be specified in the form y ~ x where \\(y\\) is the dependent variable (DV), \\(x_1\\) the first independent variable (IV1), and \\(x_2\\) the second independent variable (IV2). We then also need to include the interaction term between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\nThe data: Specify which dataframe (data =) contains the variables specified in the formula.\n\n\nrun interaction model via lm() function\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1*IV2, data = data_name)\n\nOR\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV1:IV2, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interpreting Coefficients\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting coefficients for A and B in the presence of an interaction A:B\nInterpreting the interaction term A:B\n\n\n\nWhen you include an interaction between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) in a regression model, you are estimating the extent to which the effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) is different across the values of \\(x_2\\).\nWhat this means is that the effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) depends on/is conditional upon the value of \\(x_2\\) (and vice versa, the effect of \\(x_2\\) on \\(y\\) is different across the values of \\(x_1\\)).\nThis means that we can no longer talk about the “effect of \\(x_1\\) holding \\(x_2\\) constant”. Instead we can talk about a marginal effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) at a specific value of \\(x_2\\).\n\nWhen we fit the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 (x_1 \\cdot x_2) + \\epsilon\\) using lm():\n\nthe parameter estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) is the marginal effect of \\(x_1\\) on \\(y\\) where \\(x_2 = 0\\)\n\nthe parameter estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_2\\) is the marginal effect of \\(x_2\\) on \\(y\\) where \\(x_1 = 0\\) In other words, when we fit a model with an interaction in R, we get out coefficients for both predictors, and for the interaction. The coefficients for each individual predictor reflect the effect on the outcome when the other predictor is zero.\n\n\n\n N.B. Regardless of whether or not there is an interaction term in our model, all parameter estimates in multiple regression are “conditional” in the sense that they are dependent upon the inclusion of other variables in the model. For instance, in \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon\\) the coefficient \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) is conditional upon holding \\(x_2\\) constant. \n\n\n\nThe coefficient for an interaction term can be thought of as providing an adjustment to the slope.\nLet’s take the following model as an example:\nlm(formula = y ~ x1 * x2, data = df)\n...\n\n...\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)  \n(Intercept)  ...        ....       ...      ...  \nx1           ...        ....       ...      ...  \nx2           ...        ....       ...      ...  \nx1:x2        ...        ....       ...      ...  \n---\nThese coefficients can be interpreted, in turn as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\nthe estimated \\(y\\) when all predictors (\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)) are zero is [estimate]\n\n\nx1\n\nwhen \\(x_2\\) is zero, a 1 unit increase in \\(x_1\\) is associated with a [estimate] change in \\(y\\)\n\n\n\nx2\n\nwhen \\(x_1\\) is zero, a 1 unit increase in \\(x_2\\) is associated with a [estimate] change in \\(y\\).\n\n\nx1:x2\nas \\(x_2\\) increases by 1, the association between \\(x_1\\) and \\(y\\) changes by [estimate]oras \\(x_1\\) increases by 1, the association between \\(x_2\\) and \\(y\\) changes by [estimate]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if there are other things (e.g., other predictors/covatiates) in the model too?\n\n\n\nNote that the interaction x1:x2 changes how we interpret the individual coefficients for x1 and x2.\nIt does not change how we interpret coefficients for other predictors that might be in our model. For variables that aren’t involved in the interaction term, these are still held constant.\nFor example, suppose we also had another predictor \\(c_1\\) in our model:\nlm(y ~ c1 + x1 + x2 + x1:x2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\nthe estimated \\(y\\) when all predictors (\\(c_1\\), \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\)) are zero is [estimate]\n\n\nc1\na 1 unit increase in \\(c_1\\) is associated with a [estimate] increase in \\(y\\), holding constant all other variables in the model (\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\))\n\n\nx1\nholding \\(c_1\\) constant, when \\(x_2\\) is zero, a 1 unit increase in \\(x_1\\) is associated with a [estimate] change in \\(y\\)\n\n\n\nx2\nholding \\(c_1\\) constant, when \\(x_1\\) is zero, a 1 unit increase in \\(x_2\\) is associated with a [estimate] change in \\(y\\).\n\n\nx1:x2\nholding \\(c_1\\) constant, as \\(x_2\\) increases by 1, the association between \\(x_1\\) and \\(y\\) changes by [estimate]orholding \\(c_1\\) constant, as \\(x_1\\) increases by 1, the association between \\(x_2\\) and \\(y\\) changes by [estimate]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example Data\n\n\nFor the examples in this section , we are going to use the palmer penguins dataset2.

In this specific example, there is no natural reference category, nor one that maps to our RQ, so we will go with R’s default coding and have Adelie as our reference group for species. \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Body Mass} ~=~ & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Flipper Length} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Chinstrap} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Gentoo} \\\\\n& + \\beta_4 \\cdot (\\text{Flipper Length} \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Chinstrap}) \\\\\n& + \\beta_5 \\cdot (\\text{Flipper Length} \\cdot \\text{Species}_\\text{Gentoo}) + \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\quad\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n Model Building\n\n\nNo penguins in our dataset had a flipper length of zero mm. We might want to mean centre this predictor variable so that we can consider the difference in body mass between penguin species with average flipper lengths. Before we build our model, we should mean centre this IV:\n\npenguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n   mc_flipper_length_mm = scale(flipper_length_mm, scale = FALSE)\n   )\n\nRecall that the default in R is to apply dummy coding, and thus R computes the dummy variables for us! Since we are using the default reference group, we can simply run our model (with our newly created mean centered flipper length variable):\n\nmdl_nc &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ mc_flipper_length_mm * species, data = penguins)\n\nEach row in the summary() output of the model will correspond to one of the estimated \\(\\beta\\)’s in the equation above.\n\nsummary(mdl_nc)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ mc_flipper_length_mm * species, data = penguins)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-911.18 -251.93  -31.77  197.82 1144.81 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                      Estimate Std.

Here we need to specify the model object, what we want on the x- and y-axis, and whether we want 95% CIs to be displayed.\n\nIn R\n\n## first argument is the model object we need to use to visualise the slopes\n## species is on the x axis\n## separate lines for each level of sex\n## return 95% CIs is set to true (default is false)\n\nemmip(mdl_cc, sex ~ species,\n      CIs = TRUE,\n      ylab = \"Predicted Weight (g)\",\n      xlab = \"Species\")\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Predicted Penguin Weight by Species and Sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nA simple effects analysis examined the whether there was a difference in body mass between male and female chinstrap penguins. Males \\((M = 3939~g)\\) were estimated to be heavier than females \\((M = 3527~g)\\) with an estimated difference of \\(412~g\\), and this difference was statistically significant \\(p &lt; .001\\). This difference is visually presented in Figure 7."

When this is the case, we know that our model is doing a good job predicting values at the high and low ends of our dataset, and that our residuals were somewhat symmetrical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, model coefficients highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates\nStd.

Recall the formula for obtaining a confidence interval for the population slope is:\n\\[\n\\hat \\beta_j \\pm t^* \\cdot SE(\\hat \\beta_j)\n\\] where \\(t^*\\) denotes the critical value chosen from t-distribution with \\(n-k-1\\) degrees of freedom (where \\(k\\) = number of predictors and \\(n\\) = sample size) for a desired \\(\\alpha\\) level of confidence.\n\nIn R\nWe can obtain the confidence intervals for the regression coefficients using the command confint()\n\n\n\nThe t-statistic is the \\(\\beta\\) coefficient divided by the standard error:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\hat \\beta_j - 0}{SE(\\hat \\beta_j)}\n\\]\nwhich follows a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-k-1\\) degrees of freedom (where \\(k\\) = number of predictors and \\(n\\) = sample size).\nWith this, we can test the the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_j = 0\\).\nGenerally speaking, you want your model coefficients to have large \\(t\\)-statistics as this would indicate that the standard error was small in comparison to the coefficient. The larger our \\(t\\)-statistic, the more confident we can be that the coefficient is not 0.\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(t\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named mdl):\n\ncoef(summary(mdl))[, \"t value\"]\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,3]\n\n\n\n\nFrom our \\(t\\)-value, we can compute our \\(p\\)-value. The \\(p\\)-value help us to understand whether our coefficient(s) are statistically significant (i.e., that the coefficient is statistically different from 0). The \\(p\\)-value of each estimate indicates the probability of observing a \\(t\\)-value at least as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data when assuming the null hypothesis to be true.\nIn Psychology, a \\(p\\)-value &lt; .05 is usually used to make statements regarding statistical significance (it is important that you always state your \\(\\alpha\\) level to help your reader understand any statements regarding statistical significance).\nThe number of asterisks marks corresponds with the significance of the coefficient (see the ‘Signif. codes’ legend just under the coefficients section).\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(p\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named mdl):\n\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, model standard deviation of the errors highlighted\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation of the errors, denoted by \\(\\sigma\\), is an important quantity that our model estimates.

    "text": "Multiple Comparisons\n\n Pairwise Comparisons\n\n\nWe can use pairwise comparisons when we want to compare all levels of an independent variable with all the levels of the other. In other words, we can compare all pairwise means between groups to determine whether there is a statistical difference between each pair of groups compared.\nFor example, let’s say that you had 2 categorical variables - Day (5 levels: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, and Fri) and Time (3 levels: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening) where your outcome variable was productivity level (scored on a scale 0-50). If we were to conduct all possible pairwise comparisons, this would lead to the following pairs of groups being compared on productivity:\n\nMon - Morning\n\nMon - Afternoon\n\nMon - Evening\n\nTue - Morning\n\nTue - Afternoon\n\nTue - Evening\n\nWed - Morning\n\nWed - Afternoon\n\nWed - Evening\n\nThurs - Morning\n\nThurs - Afternoon\n\nThurs - Evening\n\nFri - Morning\n\nFri - Afternoon\n\nFri - Evening\n\n\nIn R\n\n#run comparisons\npair_comp &lt;- pairs(&lt;INSERT OBJECT NAME&gt;)\n\n#examine output\npair_comp\n\n#plot comparisons\nplot(pair_comp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Why does the Number of Tests Matter?\n\n\nIf we are conducting all possible pairwise comparisons, we can calculate how many tests are being conducted via the following rule:\n\\[\n_nC_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\\\\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{align} \\\\\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& n = \\text{total number in the set} \\\\\n& r = \\text{number chosen} \\\\\n& _nC_r = \\text{number of combinations of r from n} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSo, why does the number of tests matter? First, think back to “Type 1 errors” from DAPR1 - when we conduct an hypothesis test, and we set \\(\\alpha = .05\\), we will reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) when we find a \\(p &lt; .05\\). Now remember what a \\(p\\)-value represents - it is the chance of observing a statistic at least as extreme as the one we do have, assuming the null hypothesis to be true. This means that if \\(H_0\\) is true, then we will still observe a \\(p &lt; .05\\) 5% of the time. So our chance of making this error = the threshold (\\(\\alpha\\)) at which below a \\(p\\)-value results in us rejecting \\(H_0\\).\nBut this error-rate applies to each statistical hypothesis we test. So if we conduct an experiment in which we plan on conducting lots of tests of different comparisons, the chance of an error being made increases substantially. Across the family of tests performed that chance will be much higher than 5%.3\nEach test conducted at \\(\\alpha = .05\\) has a .05 (or 5%) probability of Type I error (wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis). If we do 9 tests, that experiment-wise error rate is \\(\\alpha_{ew} \\leq 9 \\times .05\\), where 9 is the number of comparisons made as part of the experiment.\nThus, if nine independent comparisons were made at the \\(\\alpha = .05\\) level, the experiment-wise Type I error rate \\(\\alpha_{ew}\\) would be at most \\(9 \\times .05 = 0.45\\). That is, we could wrongly reject the null hypothesis on average 45 times out of 100.\nTo make this more confusing, many of the tests in a family are not independent (see the lecture slides for the calculation of error rate for dependent tests).\n\n\n\n\n\n When to use Which Correction\n\n\nBonferroni\n\nUse Bonferroni’s method when you are interested in a small number of planned contrasts (or pairwise comparisons).\nBonferroni’s method is to divide alpha by the number of tests/confidence intervals.\nAssumes that all comparisons are independent of one another.\n\nIt sacrifices slightly more power than Tukey’s method (discussed below), but it can be applied to any set of contrasts or linear combinations (i.e., it is useful in more situations than Tukey).\nIt is usually better than Tukey if we want to do a small number of planned comparisons.\n\nŠídák\n\n(A bit) more powerful than the Bonferroni method.\nAssumes that all comparisons are independent of one another.\nLess common than Bonferroni method, largely because it is more difficult to calculate (not a problem now we have computers).\n\nTukey\n\nIt specifies an exact family significance level for comparing all pairs of treatment means.\n\nUse Tukey’s method when you are interested in all (or most) pairwise comparisons of means.\n\nScheffe\n\nIt is the most conservative (least powerful) of all tests.\nIt controls the family alpha level for testing all possible contrasts.\nIt should be used if you have not planned contrasts in advance.\nFor testing pairs of treatment means it is too conservative (you should use Bonferroni or Šídák).\n\nOthers\n\nIn the wider literature, Holm’s step-down and Hochberg’s step-up mentioned. Do feel free to read about these in your spare time - there are lots of resources online.\n\n\nIn R\nYou can easily change which correction you are using via the adjust = argument.

In the lectures, and above, you will have seen this denoted as “ln”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability, Odds and Log-odds\n\n\n\nConversions\nBetween probabilities, odds and log-odds (“logit”):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\text{for probability p of Y for observation i:}\\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\nodds_i & = \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\nlogit_i &= ln(odds_i) = ln(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) \\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\np_i & = \\frac{odds_i}{1 + odds_i} = \\frac{e^{logit_i}}{(1+e^{logit_i})}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn order to understand the connections among these concepts, lets work with an example where the probability \\((p)\\) of an event occurring is 0.2:\n\nOdds of event occurring:\n\n\\[\n\\text{odds} \\quad = \\quad (\\frac{0.2}{1-0.2}) \\quad = \\quad (\\frac{0.2}{0.8}) \\quad = \\quad 0.25\n\\]\n\nLog-odds of the event occurring:\n\n\\[\n\\text{logit} \\quad = \\quad ln(\\frac{0.2}{1-0.2}) \\quad = \\quad ln(\\frac{0.2}{0.8}) \\quad = \\quad -1.3863\n\\]\n\nOR\n\n\\[\nln(0.25) \\quad = \\quad -1.3863\n\\]\n\nProbability can be reconstructed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{p} \\quad = \\quad (\\frac{0.25}{1+0.25}) \\quad = \\quad 0.2\n\\]\n\nOR\n\n\\[\n\\text{p} \\quad = \\quad \\frac{e^{-1.3863}}{1+e^{-1.3863}} \\quad = \\quad \\frac{0.25}{1.25} \\quad = \\quad 0.2\n\\]\n\nIn R\n\n\nobtain the odds\nodds &lt;- 0.2 / (1 - 0.2)\n\n\nobtain the log-odds for a given probability\nlog_odds &lt;- log(0.25)\nOR\nlog_odds &lt;- qlogis(0.2)\n\n\nobtain the probability from the odds\nprob_O &lt;- odds / (1 + odds)\n\n\nobtain the probability from the log-odds\nprob_LO &lt;- exp(log_odds) / (1 + exp(log_odds))\nOR\nprob_LO &lt;- plogis(log_odds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Non-Continuous Outcome Variables (DVs)\n\n\nThere are lots of outcome variables that we typically assess within Psychology that are not captured on a continuous scale. For example:\nBinary Variables\n\nFailure vs success\nNo vs yes\nFail vs pass\nUnemployed vs employed\nNot depressed vs depressed\n\nFor binary variables, values can only take one of two values, which we often encode as 0 or 1. Values can’t be 0.5, -2, or 1.3, they can only be 0 or 1.\nCount Variables\n\nNumber of times a person experiences a panic attack in a week\nNumber of passes\nFrequency of negative thoughts reported by an individual\n\nFor count data, values can’t take any real number, they can only take integers (0, 1, 2, 3, …).\nNeither type of outcome (i.e., binary or count) is continuous, and therefore a linear regression model is not suitable. If we were to incorrectly fit a linear model to an outcome variable measured on a non-continuous scale, then the model would likely return estimated values that are simply impossible to observe, and we’d likely be violating a few assumptions too (e.g., constant variance).\n\n\n\n\n\n Generalized Linear Models\n\n\nThe generalized linear model allows us to be able to talk about linear associations between predictors and the log-odds of an event (or between predictors and log-counts).\nIn its general form, the GLM looks pretty similar to the standard LM. We can write it as:\n\\[\n\\text{g(}\\text{y)}\\ \\quad = \\quad b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + ... + b_p \\cdot x_p\n\\] The difference is that \\(\\text{g()}\\) is a function (like log, or logit) that links the expected value of \\(\\text{y}\\) to the linear prediction of \\(b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + ... + b_p \\cdot x_k\\).\nIt’s important to note that when specifying a generalized linear model, just like with a linear model, the predictors can either be continuous and/or categorical.\n\nIn R\nIn order to fit these models in R, we need to use the glm() function. This is a generalized form of the lm() function we have used elsewhere in the course. The only difference is that we need to also tell the function the family of the outcome variable, and the “link function”.\nThe family argument takes (the name of) a family function which specifies the link function and variance function (as well as a few other arguments not entirely relevant to the purpose of this course).\nThe exponential family functions available in R are:\n\n\nbinomial (link = “logit”)\n\ngaussian (link = “identity”)\n\npoisson (link = “log”)\n\nGamma (link = “inverse”)\n\ninverse.gaussian (link = “1/mu2”)\n\nSee ?glm for other modeling options. See ?family for other allowable link functions for each family.\n\nThere are three key components to consider when selecting the family function to use when fitting GLMs:\n\nRandom component / probability distribution - The distribution of the response/outcome variable. Can be from any family of distributions as listed above\nSystematic component / linear predictor - the explanatory/predictor variable(s)\nLink function - specifies the link between a random and systematic components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Binary Logistic Regression\n\n\nWhen a response \\((y)\\) is binary coded (i.e., 0/1) we must use logistic regression.\nOutcome \\(y\\) is binary, \\(y \\in [0,1]\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n{ln \\left( \\frac{p}{1-p} \\right) } &= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + ... + b_p \\cdot x_p \\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\n\\text{where } {p} &= \\text{probability of event }y\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nIn R\nThe outcome (in our example below, binary_y) can either be 0s and 1s, or coded as a factor with 2 levels.\n\nglm(binary_y ~ x1 + x2, data = df, family = binomial(link=\"logit\"))\n\nOR\n\nglm(binary_y ~ x1 + x2, data = df, family = binomial)\n\nAs just putting family = binomial will also work (as it will by default use the “logit” link)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interpretation of Coefficients\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Steps\nCommon Interpretation Mistakes\nConverting to Probability\n\n\n\nTo interpret the fitted coefficients, we first exponentiate the model: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log \\left( \\frac{p_x}{1-p_x} \\right) &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\\\\ne^{ \\log \\left( \\frac{p_x}{1-p_x} \\right) } &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x } \\\\\n\\frac{p_x}{1-p_x} &= e^{\\beta_0} \\ e^{\\beta_1 x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand recall that the probability of success divided by the probability of failure is the odds of success\n\\[\n\\frac{p_x}{1-p_x} = \\text{odds}\n\\]\nWhen we exponentiate coefficients from a model fitted to the log-odds, the resulting association is referred to as an “odds ratio” \\((OR)\\). There are various ways of describing odds ratios:\n\n“for a 1 unit increase in \\(x\\) the odds of \\(y\\) change by a ratio of exp(b)”\n\n“for a 1 unit increase in \\(x\\) the odds of \\(y\\) are multiplied by exp(b)”\n\n“for a 1 unit increase in \\(x\\) there are exp(b) increased/decreased odds of \\(y\\)”\n\nInstead of thinking of a coefficient of 0 as indicating “no association”, in odds ratios this when the \\(OR = 1\\).\n\n\nOR = 1 : equal odds (\\(1 \\times odds = odds \\text{ don't change}\\))\n\n\nOR &lt; 1 : decreased odds (\\(0.5 \\times odds = odds \\text{ are halved}\\))\n\n\nOR &gt; 1 : increased odds (\\(2 \\times odds = odds \\text{ are doubled}\\))\n\n\nIn R\nTo translate log-odds to odds in order to aid interpretation, we can exponentiate (i.e., by using exp()) the coefficients from a model using R via the following command:\n\nexp(coef(wais_mdl))\n\nWe can also use R to extract predicted probabilities from our models.\n\nCalculate the predicted log-odds (probabilities on the logit scale): predict(model, type=\"link\")\n\nCalculate the predicted probabilities: predict(model, type=\"response\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOR are not “exp(b) times more likely”\nOften you will hear people interpreting odds ratios as “\\(y\\) is exp(b) times as likely”. Although it is true that increased odds is an increased likelihood of \\(y\\) occurring, double the odds does not mean you will see twice as many occurrences of \\(y\\) - i.e. it does not translate to doubling the probability.\nHere’s a little more step-by-step explanation to explain:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoefficient\n      b\n      exp(b)\n    \n\n\n(Intercept)\n3.76\n43.13\n\n\nage\n-0.62\n0.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor children aged 2 years old the log-odds of them taking the marshmallow are 3.76 + -0.62*2 = 2.52.\n\nTranslating this to odds, we exponentiate it, so the odds of them taking the marshmallow are \\(e^{(3.76 + -0.62*2)} = e^{2.52} = 12.43\\).\n(This is the same4 as \\(e^{3.76} \\times e^{-0.62*2}\\))\n\nThese odds of 12.43 means that (rounded to nearest whole number) if we take 13 children aged 2 years, we would expect 12 of them to take the marshmallow, and 1 to not take it.\n\nIf we consider how the odds change for every extra year of age (i.e. for 3 year old as opposed to 2 year old children):\n\nthe log-odds of taking the marshmallow decrease by -0.62.\n\nthe odds of taking the marshmallow are multiplied by 0.54.\n\nso for a 3 year old child, the odds are \\(12.43 \\times 0.54 = 6.69\\).\n(And we can also calculate this as \\(e^{2.52 + -0.62}\\))\n\n\n\nSo we have gone from odds of 12.4-to-1 for 2 year olds, and 6.7-to-1 for 3 year olds. The odds have been multiplied by 0.54.\nBut those odds, when converted to probability, these are 0.93 and 0.87. So \\(0.54 \\times odds\\) is not \\(0.54 \\times probability\\).\n\n\n\nThe intercept (but not slopes) can be converted to a probability\nBecause our intercept is at a single point (it’s not an association), we can actually convert this to a probability. Remember that \\(odds = \\frac{p}{1-p}\\), which means that \\(p = \\frac{odds}{1 + odds}\\). So the probability of taking the marshmallow for a child aged zero is \\(\\frac{43.13}{1 + 43.13} = 0.98\\).\nUnfortunately, we can’t do the same for any slope coefficients. This is because while the intercept is “odds”, the slopes are “odds ratios” (i.e. changes in odds), and changes in odds are different at different levels of probability.\nConsider how when we multiply odds by 2, the increase in probability is not constant:\n\n\nOdds\nProbability\n\n\n\n0.5\n\\(\\frac{1}{1+0.5} = 0.33\\)\n\n\n1\n\\(\\frac{1}{1+1} = 0.5\\)\n\n\n2\n\\(\\frac{2}{1+2} = 0.66\\)\n\n\n4\n\\(\\frac{4}{1+4} = 0.8\\)\n\n\n8\n\\(\\frac{8}{1+8} = 0.88\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Binary Logistic Regression - Example\n\n\nImagine that we are trying to determine whether the probability of having senility symptoms (0 = not present; 1 = present) changes as a function of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) score, where we fit the following model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Senility}: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{WAIS Score} + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIntercept\n\\[\n\\text{If }x = 0, \\qquad \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = e^{\\beta_0} \\ e^{\\beta_1 x} = e^{\\beta_0}\n\\]\nThat is, \\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) represents the odds of having symptoms of senility for individuals with a WAIS score of 0.\nIn other words, for those with a WAIS score of 0, the probability of having senility symptoms is \\(e^{\\beta_0}\\) times that of non having them.\nSlope\n\\[\n\\text{If}~~x = 1, \\quad \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1} \\quad = \\quad e^{\\beta_0} \\ e^{\\beta_1 x} \\quad = \\quad e^{\\beta_0} \\ e^{\\beta_1}\n\\]\nNow consider taking the ratio of the odds of senility symptoms when \\(x=1\\) to the odds of senility symptoms when \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{odds}_{x=1}}{\\text{odds}_{x=0}} = \\frac{p_1 / (1 - p_1)}{p_0 / (1 - p_0)}\n= \\frac{e^{\\beta_0} \\ e^{\\beta_1}}{e^{\\beta_0}}\n= e^{\\beta_1}\n\\]\nSo, \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\) represents the odds ratio for a 1 unit increase in WAIS score. We could interpret this by saying that for a one-unit increase in WAIS score, the odds of senility symptoms changed by a ratio of \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\).\n\nIn R\n\n#build glm model\nsen_mdl1 &lt;- glm(senility ~ wais, family = \"binomial\", data = sendata)\n\n#examine summary\nsummary(sen_mdl1)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = senility ~ wais, family = \"binomial\", data = sendata)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "Linear Models\nAssessing model fit involves examining metrics like the sum of squares to measure variability explained by the model, the \\(F\\)-ratio to evaluate the overall significance of the model by comparing explained variance to unexplained variance, and \\(R\\)-squared / Adjusted \\(R\\)-squared to quantify the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s).\n\n Sums of Squares\n\n\nTo quantify and assess a model’s utility in explaining variance in an outcome variable, we can split the total variability of that outcome variable into two terms: the variability explained by the model plus the variability left unexplained in the residuals.\nThe sum of squares measures the deviation or variation of data points away from the mean (i.e., how spread out are the numbers in a given dataset). We are trying to find the equation/function that best fits our data by varying the least from our data points.\nTotal Sum of Squares\nFormula:\n\\[\nSS_{Total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n\\] Can also be derived from:\n\\[\nSS_{Total} = SS_{Model} + SS_{Residual}\n\\]\nIn words:\nSquared distance of each data point from the mean of \\(y\\).\nDescription:\nHow much variation there is in the DV.\nResidual Sum of Squares\nFormula:\n\\[\nSS_{Residual} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n\\]\nIn words:\nSquared distance of each point from the predicted value.\nDescription:\nHow much of the variation in the DV the model did not explain - a measure that captures the unexplained variation in your regression model. Lower residual sum of squares suggests that your model fits the data well, and higher suggests that the model poorly explains the data (in other words, the lower the value, the better the regression model). If the value was zero here, it would suggest the model fits perfectly with no error.\nModel Sum of Squares\nFormula:\n\\[\nSS_{Model} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2\n\\]\nCan also be derived from:\n\\[\nSS_{Model} = SS_{Total} - SS_{Residual}\n\\] In words:\nThe deviance of the predicted scores from the mean of \\(y\\).\nDescription:\nHow much of the variation in the DV your model explained - like a measure that captures how well the regression line fits your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n F-ratio\n\n\nOverview:\nWe can perform a test to investigate if a model is ‘useful’ — that is, a test to see if our explanatory variable explains more variance in our outcome than we would expect by just some random chance variable.\nWith one predictor, the \\(F\\)-statistic is used to test the null hypothesis that the regression slope for that predictor is zero:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{the model is ineffective, }b_1 = 0 \\\\  \n\\] \\[\nH_1 : \\text{the model is effective, }b_1  \\neq 0 \\\\  \n\\]\nIn multiple regression, the logic is the same, but we are now testing against the null hypothesis that all regression slopes are zero. Our test is framed in terms of the following hypotheses:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{the model is ineffective, }b_1,...., b_k = 0 \\\\    \n\\]\n\\[\nH_1 : \\text{the model is effective, }b_1,...., b_k  \\neq 0 \\\\  \n\\]\nThe relevant test-statistic is the \\(F\\)-statistic, which uses “Mean Squares” (these are Sums of Squares divided by the relevant degrees of freedom). We then compare that against (you guessed it) an \\(F\\)-distribution! \\(F\\)-distributions vary according to two parameters, which are both degrees of freedom.\nFormula:\n\\[\nF_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{Residual}} = \\frac{SS_{Model}/df_{Model}}{SS_{Residual}/df_{Residual}} \\\\\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& df_{model} = k \\\\\n& df_{residual} = n-k-1 \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k  = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nDescription:\nTo test the significance of an overall model, we can conduct an \\(F\\)-test. The \\(F\\)-test compares your model to a model containing zero predictor variables (i.e., the intercept only model), and tests whether your added predictor variables significantly improved the model.\nIt is called the \\(F\\)-ratio because it is the ratio of the how much of the variation is explained by the model (per parameter) versus how much of the variation is unexplained (per remaining degrees of freedom).\nThe \\(F\\)-test involves testing the statistical significance of the \\(F\\)-ratio.\nQ: What does the \\(F\\)-ratio test?A: The null hypothesis that all regression slopes in a model are zero (i.e., explain no variance in your outcome/DV). The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the slopes is not zero.\nThe \\(F\\)-ratio you see at the bottom of summary(model) is actually a comparison between two models: your model (with some explanatory variables in predicting \\(y\\)) and the null model.\nIn regression, the null model can be thought of as the model in which all explanatory variables have zero regression coefficients. It is also referred to as the intercept-only model, because if all predictor variable coefficients are zero, then we are only estimating \\(y\\) via an intercept (which will be the mean - \\(\\bar y\\)).\nInterpretation:\nAlongside viewing the \\(F\\)-ratio, you can see the results from testing the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients are \\(0\\) (the alternative hypothesis is that at least one coefficient is \\(\\neq 0\\). Under the null hypothesis that all coefficients = 0, the ratio of explained:unexplained variance should be approximately 1)\nIf your model predictors do explain some variance, the \\(F\\)-ratio will be significant, and you would reject the null, as this would suggest that your predictor variables included in your model improved the model fit (in comparison to the intercept only model).\nPoints to note:\n\nThe larger your \\(F\\)-ratio, the better your model\nThe \\(F\\)-ratio will be close to 1 when the null is true (i.e., that all slopes are zero)\n\n\nIn R\nWe can see the \\(F\\)-statistic and associated \\(p\\)-value at the bottom of the output of summary(&lt;modelname&gt;):\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, F statistic highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nThe linear model with recall confidence and age explained a significant amount of variance in recall accuracy beyond what we would expect by chance \\(F(2, 17) = 12.92, p &lt; .001\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R-squared and Adjusted R-squared\n\n\nOverview:\n\\(R^2\\) represents the proportion of variance in \\(Y\\) that is explained by the model predictor variables.\nFormula:\nThe \\(R^2\\) coefficient is defined as the proportion of the total variability in the outcome variable which is explained by our model: \\[\nR^2 = \\frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}\n\\]\nThe Adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient is defined as: \\[\n\\hat R^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nWhen to report Multiple \\(R^2\\) vs. Adjusted \\(R^2\\):\nThe Multiple \\(R^2\\) value should be reported for a simple linear regression model (i.e., one predictor).\nUnlike \\(R^2\\), Adjusted-\\(R^2\\) does not necessarily increase with the addition of more explanatory variables, by the inclusion of a penalty according to the number of explanatory variables in the model. Since Adjusted-\\(R^2\\) is adjusted for the number of predictors in the model, this should be used when there are 2 or more predictors in the model. As a side note, the Adjusted-\\(R^2\\) should always be less than or equal to \\(R^2\\).\n\nIn R\nWe can see both \\(R^2\\) and Adjusted-\\(R^2\\) in the second bottom row of the summary(&lt;modelname&gt;):\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, R^2 statistic highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nTogether, recall confidence and age explained approximately 55.66% of the variance in recall accuracy."

This is called a likelihood ratio test.\n\n Drop-in-Deviance Test to Compare Nested Models\n\n\nIn the generalized linear model world, we don’t have straightforward residuals, and we compare models on a different metric, known as deviance. With a big enough sample size, reductions in deviance are \\(\\chi^2\\) distributed, meaning that we can compare them to an appropriate \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution to compute a p-value.\nThe only caveat is that the two models must be nested, i.e. one model needs to be a simplification of the other, and all predictors of one model needs to be within the other.\nWe want to compare the model we previously fitted against a model where all slopes are 0, i.e. a baseline model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_1 : \\qquad\\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p} \\right) &= \\beta_0 \\\\\nM_2 : \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p} \\right) &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nIn R\n\nmdl_reduced &lt;- glm(DV ~ 1, family = \"binomial\", data = dataset)\nmdl_main &lt;- glm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 ... + IV4, family = \"binomial\", data = dataset)\n\nanova(mdl_red, mdl_main, test = 'Chisq')\n\nIn the output you can see the residual deviance of each model.

Hence, we have strong evidence that the subjects’ WAIS was a helpful predictor of whether or not participants will experience symptoms of senility.\n\n\n\n\n\n AIC & BIC\n\n\nDeviance measures lack of fit, and it can be reduced to zero by making the model more and more complex, effectively estimating the value at each single data point. However, this involves adding more and more predictors, which makes the model more complex (and less interpretable).\nTypically, the simpler model should be preferred when it can still explain the data almost as well. This is why information criteria were devised, exactly to account for both the model misfit but also its complexity.\n\\[\n\\text{Information Criterion} = \\text{Deviance} + \\text{Penalty for model complexity}\n\\]\nDepending on the chosen penalty, you get different criteria. Two common ones are the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, AIC and BIC respectively:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{AIC} &= \\text{Deviance} + 2 p \\\\\n\\text{BIC} &= \\text{Deviance} + p \\log(n)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the sample size and \\(p\\) is the number of regression coefficients in the model. Models that produce smaller values of these fit criteria should be preferred.\nAIC and BIC differ in their degrees of penalization for number of regression coefficients, with BIC usually favouring models with fewer terms.\n\nIn R\nWe can calculate AIC and BIC by using the AIC() and BIC() functions respectively:\n\n#AIC\nAIC(sen_mdl0, sen_mdl1)\n\n         df      AIC\nsen_mdl0  1 63.80632\nsen_mdl1  2 55.01738\n\n#BIC\nBIC(sen_mdl0, sen_mdl1)\n\n         df      BIC\nsen_mdl0  1 65.79530\nsen_mdl1  2 58.99535\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nBased on both AIC and BIC, the model including the subjects’ WAIS as a predictor of symptoms of senility was better fitting (\\(AIC = 55.017;~ BIC = 59.00\\)) than the model with age alone (\\(AIC = 63.81;~ BIC = 66.00\\)).

    "text": "Linear Models\nLinear models rely on numerous underlying assumptions about the data. These assumptions ensure that the association between variables is appropriately captured, and that inferences drawn from the model are accurate and valid. Model diagnostics can help further assess whether these assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, there are numerous techniques that can be employed, such as through data transformations or using robust alternatives, to ensure reliable model interpretations.\n\n Linearity\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression\nIn simple linear regression with only one explanatory variable, we could assess linearity through a simple scatterplot of the outcome variable against the explanatory. This would allow us to check if the errors have a mean of zero. If this assumption was met, the residuals would appear to be randomly scattered around zero.\nThe rationale for this is that, once you remove from the data the linear trend, what’s left over in the residuals should not have any trend, i.e. have a mean of zero.\nMultiple Regression\nIn multiple regression, however, it becomes more necessary to rely on diagnostic plots of the model residuals. This is because we need to know whether the relations are linear between the outcome and each predictor after accounting for the other predictors in the model.\nIn order to assess this, we use partial-residual plots (also known as ‘component-residual plots’). This is a plot with each explanatory variable \\(x_j\\) on the x-axis, and partial residuals on the y-axis***.\nPartial residuals for a predictor \\(x_j\\) are calculated as: \\[\n\\hat \\epsilon + \\hat \\beta_j x_j\n\\]\n\nIn R\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression\nMultiple Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\n#specify model\nrecall_simp &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plot\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, colour = \"blue\") + #fit straight line to data\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, colour = \"red\") + #fit loess line to data\n    labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Recall Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nThe loess line should closely follow the data.\n\n\n\nWe can create these plots for all predictors in the model by using the crPlots() function from the car package:\n\n#specify model\nrecall_mdl &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ recall_confidence + age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plots\ncrPlots(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nYou are looking for the pink line to follow a linear trend line (i.e., follow the blue line). In other words, the loess line should closely follow the linear line.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant to Note for Interaction Models\n***When there is an interaction in the model, assessing linearity becomes difficult. In fact, crPlots() will not work. To assess, you can create a residuals-vs-fitted plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Independence (of errors)\n\n\nThe ‘independence of errors’ assumption is the condition that the errors do not have some underlying relationship which is causing them to influence one another. \nThere are many sources of possible dependence, and often these are issues of study design. For example, we may have groups of observations in our data which we would expect to be related (e.g., multiple trials from the same participant). Our modelling strategy would need to take this into account. \nOne form of dependence is autocorrelation - this is when observations influence those adjacent to them. It is common in data for which time is a variable of interest (e.g, the humidity today is dependent upon the rainfall yesterday).\nTesting for the independence of errors can be pretty difficult, unless you know the potential source of correlation between cases (more on this in DAPR3!).\n\n\n\n\n\n Normality (of errors)\n\n\nThe normality assumption is the condition that the errors \\(\\epsilon\\) are normally distributed in the population.\nWe can visually assess this condition through histograms, density plots, and quantile-quantile plots (QQplots) of our residuals \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\).\n\n\nHistogram\nQQPlot\n\n\n\n\nhist(recall_mdl$residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(recall_mdl, which = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nRemember that departures from a linear trend in QQ plots indicate a lack of normality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Equal Variances (Homoscedasticity)\n\n\nThe equal variances assumption is that the error variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is constant across values of the predictor(s) \\(x_1, \\dots, x_k\\), and across values of the fitted values \\(\\hat y\\). This sometimes gets termed “Constant” vs “Non-constant” variance. This is presented visually in Figure 10 and Figure 11.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Non-constant variance for numeric and categorical X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Constant variance for numeric and categorical X\n\n\n\n\nIn R\nWe can create plots of the Pearson residuals against the predicted values \\(\\hat y\\) and against the predictors \\(x_1\\), … \\(x_k\\) by using the residualPlots() function from the car package. This function also provides the results of a lack-of-fit test for each of these relationships (note when it is the fitted values \\(\\hat y\\) it gets called “Tukey’s test”).\n\nlibrary(car)\nresidualPlots(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Test stat Pr(&gt;|Test stat|)\nrecall_confidence    1.4473           0.1671\nage                 -0.0474           0.9627\nTukey test           0.8769           0.3805\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\nplot(recall_mdl, which = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nIf the assumption is met, you should see a random scatter of \\((x,y)\\) points with constant mean and variance functions i.e., the vertical spread of the residuals should roughly be the same everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Useful Assumption Plots\n\n\n\n\nplot(modelname)\ncheck_model(modelname)\n\n\n\nWe can run plot(mymodel) which will cycle through these plots (asking us to press enter each time to move to the next plot), or we can arrange these plots in a matrix via par(mfrow), for example in a 2 x 2 matrix as shown below (make sure to always reset your graphical parameters! If needed, we could also extract specific plots using, for instance: plot(mymodel, which = 3) for the third plot.\n\nIn R\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\n\nTop Left: For the Residuals vs Fitted plot, we want the red line to be horizontal at close to zero across the plot. We don’t want the residuals (the points) to be fanning in/out.\n\nTop Right: For the Normal Q-Q plot, we want the residuals (the points) to follow closely to the diagonal line, indicating that they are relatively normally distributed.5\n\nBottom Left: For the Scale-Location plot, we want the red line to be horizontal across the plot. These plots allow us to examine the extent to which the variance of the residuals changes across the fitted values. If it is angled, we are likely to see fanning in/out of the points in the residuals vs fitted plot.\nBottom Right: The Residuals vs Leverage plot indicates points that might be of individual interest as they may be unduly influencing the model. There are funnel-shaped lines on this plot (sometimes out of scope of the plotting window). Ideally, we want our residuals inside the funnel - the further the residual is to the right (the more leverage it has), the closer to the 0 we want it to be.\n\nNote, if we have only categorical predictors in our model, many of these will show vertical lines of points. This doesn’t indicate that anything is wrong, and the same principles described above continue to apply\n\n\n\nThe check_model() function from the performance package is a useful way to check the assumptions of models, as it also returns some useful notes to aid your interpretation. However, it is important to check each assumption individually with plots that are more suitable for a statistics report.\n\nIn R\n\nlibrary(performance)\ncheck_model(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multicollinearity\n\n\nFor the linear model with multiple explanatory variables, we need to also think about multicollinearity - this is when two (or more) of the predictors in our regression model are moderately or highly correlated.\nWe can assess multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF), which for a given predictor \\(x_j\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nVIF_j = \\frac{1}{1-R_j^2} \\\\\n\\]\nImportant to Note for Interaction Models\nInteraction terms often result in multicollinearity, because these terms are made up of the product of some ‘main effects’. Mean-centering the variables will help to reduce this source of structural multicollinearity (“structural” here refers to the fact that multicollinearity is due to our model specification, rather than the data itself).\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nSuggested cut-offs for VIF are varied. Some suggest 10, others 5. Define what you will consider an acceptable value prior to calculating it. You could loosely interpret VIF values \\(&gt;5\\) as moderate multicollinearity and values \\(&gt;10\\) as severe multicollinearity.\n\n\nIn R\nThe vif() function from the car package will provide VIF values for each predictor in your model.\n\nvif(INSERT_MODEL_NAME)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Individual Case Diagnostics\n\n\nWe have seen that some specific individual cases in our data can influence our model more than others. We can identify these as:\n\n\nRegression outliers: A large residual \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i\\) - i.e., a big discrepancy between their predicted y-value and their observed y-value.\n\n\nStandardised residuals: For residual \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i\\), divide by the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals. In R, the rstandard() function will give you these\n\nStudentised residuals: For residual \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i\\), divide by the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals excluding case \\(i\\). In R, the rstudent() function will give you these.\n\n\n\nHigh leverage cases: These are cases which have considerable potential to influence the regression model (e.g., cases with an unusual combination of predictor values).\n\n\nHat values: are used to assess leverage. In R, The hatvalues() function will retrieve these.\n\n\n\nHigh influence cases: When a case has high leverage and is an outlier, it will have a large influence on the regression model.\n\n\nCook’s Distance: combines leverage (hatvalues) with outlying-ness to capture influence: \\(D_i = \\text{Outlyingness} \\times \\text{Leverage}\\). Cook’s distance refers to the average distance the \\(\\hat{y}\\) values will move if a given case is removed. In R, the cooks.distance() function will provide these values. Alongside Cook’s Distance, we can examine the extent to which model estimates and predictions are affected when an entire case is dropped from the dataset and the model is refitted.\n\n\n\n\nDFFit: the change in the predicted value at the \\(i^{th}\\) observation with and without the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is included in the regression.\n\n\nDFbeta: the change in a specific coefficient with and without the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is included in the regression. DFbeta represents the difference in the beta coefficients when a case is excluded from the model versus when it’s included. A large DFbeta value would suggest that a case has a substantial impact on the estimated coefficients, and thus a high influence on the model results; a small DFbeta value would suggest that the case has less influence on the estimated coefficients. A commonly used cut-off or threshold to compare \\(|DFBETA|\\) values (absolute values) against is \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) (see Belsley et al., (1980) p. 28 for more info)6.\n\nDFbetas: the change in a specific coefficient divided by the standard error, with and without the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is included in the regression.\n\n\nCOVRATIO: measures the effect of an observation on the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. In simpler terms, it captures an observation’s influence on standard errors. Values which are \\(&gt;1+\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) or \\(&lt;1-\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) are considered as having strong influence.\n\n\nIn R, we can get lots of these measures with the influence.measures() function:\n\n\ninfluence.measures(my_model) will give you out a dataframe of the various measures.\n\nsummary(influence.measures(my_model)) will provide a nice summary of what R deems to be the influential points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next Steps: What to do with Violations of Assumptions / Problematic Case Diagnostic Results\n\n\nThere are lots of different options available, and there is no one right answer. Assuming that we have no issues with model specification (i.e., are not missing variables, have modeled appropriately), then we may want to consider one of the below approaches (note: this is not an exhaustive list!)\n\n\nInvestigate Observations\nSensitivity Analysis\nBootstrapping\nOLS vs WLS Regression\nData Transformations\nUsing Non-Linear Models\nRemoving Observations\n\n\n\nThe first step is to re-examine your data. It is important to be familiar with your dataset, as you need to know what values are typical, normal, and possible. Could it be the case that you have missed some impossible values (e.g., a negative value of a persons height), values outwith the possible range (e.g., a score of 55 on a survey where scores can only range 10-50), values that don’t make any sense (e.g., an age of 200), or maybe there are even typos / data entry errors (e.g., forgetting to put a decimal point, so having a height of 152m instead of 1.52m)!\nIf there is a simple error in the data, it could be that you can fix the typo. If that is not possible (maybe you didn’t collect the data, so are unsure of what the value(s) should/could be), you will need to delete the value (i.e., set as an NA), because you know that it is incorrect.\nWe should aim to never change a legitimate value where possible (and remember that if you have a large dataset, a small number of extreme values will be unlikely to have a strong influence on your results).\nIf there is an extreme, but legitimate value that you have determined is adversely influencing your model (i.e., by examining the assumptions and diagnostics as outlined above), you may want to consider ways to reduce this influence (e.g., winsorizing - which essentially truncates or caps the identified extreme values to a specified percentile, in turn reducing their influence on the model without completely eliminating the observation(s). For example, you could replace values below the 5th percentile with the 5th percentile value, and values above the 95th percentile with the 95th percentile value).\nIf after re-examining your data you cannot identify any atypical, non-normal, or impossible values, you may need to select a different approach as outlined below.\n\n\nThis allows us to assess the sensitivity of our results (i.e., parameter estimates, p-values, confidence intervals) to changes in our modelling approach (i.e., the removal of observations).\nWe can re-fit our model after excluding our identified outliers and potentially influential observations, and compare these results to the original model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Removing Observations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current example involves removing all identified outliers and potentially influential observations at the same time. Ideally, and to ensure a more thorough sensitivity analysis, you would remove each of these observations one at a time, assess the effects on the model by comparing to your original, reassessing the remaining pre-identified observations, and repeating the process if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Model\nModel with Observations Removed\nCompare summary() output\n\n\n\n\n## wellbeing model\nwb_mdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata) \nsummary(wb_mdl1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-15.7611  -3.1308  -0.4213   3.3126  18.8406 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We re-fit the model, excluding these 28 observations (14% of our original sample), and compared these model results (wb_mdl2) to those of our original model (wb_mdl1).\nThere was little difference in the estimates from wb_mdl1 and wb_mdl2, and so we can conclude that after conducting a sensitivity analysis, there were no meaningful differences in our results, and hence our conclusions from our original model hold. Specifically:\n\nThe direction of all model estimates are the same in wb_mdl1 and wb_mdl2 (i.e., all positive)\nThere is no difference in statistical significance, and the p-values were of a similar magnitude (i.e., all &lt; .001)\nThe estimate and confidence intervals for outdoor_time are very similar\nThere are some quantitative differences in the estimate and confidence intervals for social_int. The estimate differs slightly in magnitude by 0.07), but given that this remains positive and significant, we do not need to be too concerned about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bootstrap method is an alternative non-parametric method of constructing a standard error. Instead of having to rely on calculating the standard error with a formula and potentially applying fancy mathematical corrections, bootstrapping involves mimicking the idea of “repeatedly sampling from the population”. It does so by repeatedly resampling with replacement from our original sample.\nWhat this means is that we don’t have to rely on any assumptions about our model residuals, because we actually generate an actual distribution that we can take as an approximation of our sampling distribution, meaning that we can actually look at where 95% of the distribution falls, without having to rely on any summing of squared deviations.\nNote, the bootstrap may provide us with an alternative way of conducting inference, but our model may still be mis-specified. It is also very important to remember that bootstrapping is entirely reliant on utilising our original sample to pretend that it is a population (and mimic sampling from that population). If our original sample is not representative of the population that we’re interested in, bootstrapping doesn’t help us at all.\n\n\nThe method of ordinary least squares regression (OLS: i.e., the type of regression model you have been fitting on the course) assumes that there is constant variance in the errors (homoscedasticity). The method of weighted least squares (WLS) can be used when the ordinary least squares assumption of constant variance in the errors is violated (i.e., you have evidence of heteroscedasticity, like we do in Q3 of this lab).\nIf we have some specific belief that your non-constant variance is due to differences in the variances of the outcome between various groups, then it might be better to use Weighted Least Squares.\nAs an example, imagine we are looking at weight of different dog breeds (Figure 12). The weights of chihuahuas are all quite close together (between 2 to 5kg), but the weight of, for example, spaniels is anywhere from 8 to 25kg - a much bigger variance.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The weights of 49 dogs, of 7 breeds\n\n\n\nRecall that the default way that lm() deals with categorical predictors such as dog breed, is to compare each one to a reference level. In this case, that reference level is “beagle” (first in the alphabet). Looking at Figure 12 above, which comparison do you feel more confident in?\n\n\nA: Beagles (14kg) vs Pugs (9.1kg). A difference of 4.9kg.\n\n\nB: Beagles (14kg) vs Spaniels (19kg). A difference of 5kg.\n\nHopefully, your intuition is that A looks like a clearer difference than B because there’s less overlap between Beagles and Pugs than between Beagles and Spaniels. Our standard linear model, however, assumes the standard errors are identical for each comparison:\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ breed, data = dogdf)\n...\nCoefficients:\n                      Estimate Std.

We can transform the outcome variable prior to fitting the model, using something such as log(y) or sqrt(y). This will sometimes allow us to estimate a model for which our assumptions are satisfied.\nSome of the most common (not an exhaustive list) transformations are:\n\n\nLog (log(y)): Often used for reducing right skewness. Note, this transformation cannot be applied to zero or negative values (make sure to check your data!)\n\nSquare root (sqrt(y)): Also often used for reducing right skewness. This transformation can be applied to zero values (but not negative), and is commonly applied to count data\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: A model of a transformed outcome variable can sometimes avoid violations of assumptions that arise when modeling the outcome variable directly. Data from https://uoepsy.github.io/data/trouble1.csv\n\n\n\nThe major downside of this is that we are no longer modelling \\(y\\), but some transformation \\(f(y)\\) (\\(y\\) with some function \\(f\\) applied to it). Interpretation of the coefficients changes accordingly, such that we are no longer talking in terms of changes in y, but changes in \\(f(y)\\). When the transformation function used is non-linear (see the Right-Hand of Figure 14) a change in \\(f(y)\\) is not the same for every \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: The log transformation is non-linear\n\n\n\nFor certain transformations, we can re-express coefficients to be interpretable with respect to \\(y\\) itself. For instance, the model using a log transform \\(ln(y) = b_0 + b_1(x)\\) gives us a coefficient that represents statement A below. We can re-express this by taking the opposite function to logarithm, the exponent, exp(). Similar to how this works in logistic regression, the exponentiated coefficients obtained from exp(coef(model)) are multiplicative, meaning we can say something such as statement B\n\n\n\nA: “a 1 unit change in \\(x\\) is associated with a \\(b\\) unit change in \\(ln(y)\\)”.\n\n\nB: “a 1 unit change in \\(x\\) is associated with \\(e^b\\) percent change in \\(y\\).”\n\n\nFinding the optimal transformation to use can be difficult, but there are methods out there to help you. One such method is the BoxCox transformation, which can be conducted using BoxCox(variable, lambda=\"auto\"), from the forecast package.7\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Models\nHigher Order Terms\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLMs) can appropriately deal with data that do not follow a normal distribution (which is a requirement for traditional linear models). They can accommodate various types of distributions, including the Poisson, binomial, and gamma distributions. This makes them suitable for modelling count data (e.g., number of sunny days Edinburgh has per year - yes, count data can include 0!), binary data (where there are only two possible values e.g., doesn’t wear glasses vs wear glasses, smoker vs non-smoker, i.e., values that are yes/no or 0/1), and other types of non-normal data.\nWe will explore some GLMs later in the course (Semester 2 Block 4), where we will work with logistic regression models.\n\n\nHigher order regression terms refer to the inclusion of polynomial terms of degree higher than one in a regression model. In a linear regression model, the association between the dependent variable (\\(Y\\)) and the independent variable (\\(X\\)) is assumed to be linear, which means the association can be represented by a straight line. However, in many real-world scenarios, associations between variables are not strictly linear, and including higher order regression terms can help capture more complex relationships. Higher order terms that you could incorporate include quadratic, cubic, or higher degree polynomial terms.\nFor example, in a quadratic regression model, the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) can be represented as:\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^2 + \\epsilon\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& Y = \\text{Dependent Variable} \\\\\n& X = \\text{Independent Variable} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs in our models we’ve seen so far, \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), and \\(\\beta_2\\) are the coefficients to be estimated in the above model. What is different from what we’ve seen in DAPR2 is the term \\(\\beta_2 \\cdot X^2\\), and this represents the quadratic term. This allows for a curved as opposed to straight line to represent the association between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\), and hence can allow us to capture more complex relationships. For example, we can model the association between height and age:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Two linear models, one with a quadratic term (right)\n\n\n\nPlease note that these types of models are beyond the scope of the DAPR2 course, but if you want to know more, please do read up on these in your own time.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving outliers and potentially influential observations should be a last resort - not all outliers are inherently ‘bad’ - we do expect natural variation in our population(s) of interest. Outliers can be informative about the topic under investigation, and this is why you need to be very careful about excluding outliers due only to their ‘extremeness’. In doing so, you can distort your results by removing variability - i.e., by forcing the data to be more normal and less variable than it actually is, and reduce statistical power by reducing the size of your sample.\nIf you do decide to remove observations, you will need to document what specific data points you excluded, and provide an explanation as to why these were excluded.\nTo set specific values to NA in our dataset (and save this updated dataset in a new object named mwdata2), we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to set any age values of &lt;20 as NA. In the original dataset mwdata, we had 3 individuals aged 18, and 6 aged 19, so we should end up with 9 NA values in mwdata2 column age:\n\n#specify age column in original dataset, where age is &lt; 20, for values to be set to NA and save to new object named mwdata2 to avoid overwriting original data\nmwdata2 &lt;-  mwdata %&gt;% \n    mutate(age = replace(age, age &lt; 20, NA))\n\n#check how many NA values we have - there should be 9 (so 9 TRUEs):\ntable(is.na(mwdata2$age))\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  191     9 \n\n\nIf we wanted to remove a full row from the datset, we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to remove all rows that were highlighted in the above assumption and diagnostic checks as potentially having an adverse influence on our model estimates:\n\n# create new dataset 'mwdata3' without (by specifying -) identified outliers and potentially influential observations\nmwdata3 &lt;- mwdata[-c(16, 25, 50, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 85, 101, 109, 125, 126, 127, 131, 149, 151, 159, 163, 165, 169, 173, 176, 179, 197), ]\n\n# check dimensions - should now have 32 rows less than original dataset 200 - 32 = 168\ndim(mwdata3)\n\n[1] 168   7"

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nDensity plots and histograms will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing and social interactions, and the strength of association between the two variables estimated via the correlation coefficient. To understand how these associations differ between rural and non-rural locations, scatterplots will be used.\nTo address the research question of whether the association between the number of social interactions and wellbeing differs between rural and non-rural residents, we are going to fit the following interaction model (where not rural will be specified as the reference group for location).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Wellbeing} ~=~ & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Social Interactions} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Location}_\\text{Rural} \\\\\n& + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Social Interactions} \\cdot \\text{Location}_\\text{Rural}) + \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\quad\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_3 = 0\\)\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is not moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0\\)\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nCheck coding of variables (e.g., that categorical variables are coded as factors).\nAs specified in Q1, we want ‘not rural’ as the reference group, so make sure to specify this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the specifying reference levels flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nCheck coding of variables within ruraldata and ensure isRural is a factor with two levels, ‘rural’ and ‘not rural’:\n\n# check structure of dataset \nstr(ruraldata) \n\nspc_tbl_ [200 × 6] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ age         : num [1:200] 28 56 25 60 19 34 41 41 35 53 ...\n $ outdoor_time: num [1:200] 12 5 19 25 9 18 17 11 12 13 ...\n $ social_int  : num [1:200] 13 15 11 15 18 13 19 12 13 15 ...\n $ routine     : num [1:200] 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 ...\n $ wellbeing   : num [1:200] 36 41 35 35 32 34 39 43 35 37 ...\n $ isRural     : chr [1:200] \"rural\" \"rural\" \"rural\" \"rural\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   age = col_double(),\n  ..   outdoor_time = col_double(),\n  ..   social_int = col_double(),\n  ..   routine = col_double(),\n  ..   wellbeing = col_double(),\n  ..   isRural = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n#alternatively run is.factor() for specific variable\nis.factor(ruraldata$isRural) \n\n[1] FALSE\n\n#set isRural as a factor\nruraldata &lt;- ruraldata %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        isRural = factor(isRural, \n                           levels = c('not rural', 'rural')))\n\n\n#check the levels, and make sure 'not rural' is first\nlevels(ruraldata$isRural)\n\n[1] \"not rural\" \"rural\""

There was a weak, positive association between wellbeing and social interactions \\((r = .24)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets look at wellbeing scores by location:\n\nggplot(data = ruraldata, aes(x = isRural, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Location\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in rural locations appear to have lower wellbeing scores in comparison to those in non-rural locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lets produce our plots with a facet for rural vs non-rural residents:\n\nggplot(data = ruraldata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~isRural, labeller = \"label_both\") + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr instead of facets, we could use different colors for each location (rural vs non-rural):\n\nggplot(data = ruraldata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing, colour = isRural)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n    scale_colour_discrete(\n    name =\"Location\",\n    labels=c(\"Not Rural\", \"Rural\")) + \n    labs(x = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in non-rural locations appear to have higher wellbeing scores across almost all levels of social interactions. The slopes appear to be different for each location, where the greatest difference in wellbeing scores by location is most visible the highest number of social interactions. This suggests that there may be an interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know there might be an interaction?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lines in the two plots above do not run in parallel - this suggested the presence of an interaction. Specifically in our example, the non-parallel lines suggested an interaction effect based on location, as the number of social interactions did not appear to have the same influence on rural and non-rural residents’ wellbeing scores.\nHowever, the only way we can determine whether there is actually an interaction is by including an interaction term in our model, and testing this."

The \\(F\\)-test for model utility was significant \\((F(3,196) = 27.49, p &lt; .001)\\), and the model explained approximately 28.54% of the variability in wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores).\nThere was a significant conditional association between wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores) and the number of weekly social interactions \\((\\beta = 0.65,~ SE = 0.12,~ t(196) = 5.59,~ p &lt; .001)\\), which suggested that for those living in non-rural locations, wellbeing scores increased by 0.65 for every additional social interaction per week. A significant conditional association was also evident between wellbeing and location \\((\\beta = -4.86,~ SE = 0.65,~ t(196) = -7.50,~ p &lt; .001)\\), which suggested that for those who have the average number of social interactions per week \\((M = 12.06)\\), wellbeing scores were 4.86 points lower for those in rural areas in comparison to those in non-rural.\nThe association between wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores) and social interactions was found to be dependent upon location (rural/non-rural), and this was significant \\((\\beta = -0.52,~ SE = 0.16,~ t(196) = -3.21, ~p = .002)\\). The expected increase in wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores) for every additional social interaction per week was 0.52 points less for those living in rural locations in comparison to those in non-rural. This interaction is visually presented in Figure 4. Therefore, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the association between wellbeing and social interactions is not moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area)."

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nDensity plots and histograms will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing and social interactions, and the strength of association between the two variables estimated via the correlation coefficient. To understand how these associations differ between rural and non-rural locations, scatterplots will be used.\nTo address the research question of whether the association between the number of social interactions and wellbeing differs between rural and non-rural residents, we are going to fit the following interaction model (where not rural will be specified as the reference group for location).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Wellbeing} ~=~ & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Social Interactions} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Location}_\\text{Rural} \\\\\n& + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Social Interactions} \\cdot \\text{Location}_\\text{Rural}) + \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\quad\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_3 = 0\\)\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is not moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0\\)\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nCheck coding of variables (e.g., that categorical variables are coded as factors).\nAs specified in Q1, we want ‘not rural’ as the reference group, so make sure to specify this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the specifying reference levels flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nCheck coding of variables within ruraldata and ensure isRural is a factor with two levels, ‘rural’ and ‘not rural’:\n\n# check structure of dataset \nstr(ruraldata) \n\nspc_tbl_ [200 × 6] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ age         : num [1:200] 28 56 25 60 19 34 41 41 35 53 ...\n $ outdoor_time: num [1:200] 12 5 19 25 9 18 17 11 12 13 ...\n $ social_int  : num [1:200] 13 15 11 15 18 13 19 12 13 15 ...\n $ routine     : num [1:200] 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 ...\n $ wellbeing   : num [1:200] 36 41 35 35 32 34 39 43 35 37 ...\n $ isRural     : chr [1:200] \"rural\" \"rural\" \"rural\" \"rural\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   age = col_double(),\n  ..   outdoor_time = col_double(),\n  ..   social_int = col_double(),\n  ..   routine = col_double(),\n  ..   wellbeing = col_double(),\n  ..   isRural = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n#alternatively run is.factor() for specific variable\nis.factor(ruraldata$isRural) \n\n[1] FALSE\n\n#set isRural as a factor\nruraldata &lt;- ruraldata %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        isRural = factor(isRural, \n                           levels = c('not rural', 'rural')))\n\n\n#check the levels, and make sure 'not rural' is first\nlevels(ruraldata$isRural)\n\n[1] \"not rural\" \"rural\""

There was a weak, positive association between wellbeing and social interactions \\((r = .24)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets look at wellbeing scores by location:\n\nggplot(data = ruraldata, aes(x = isRural, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Location\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in rural locations appear to have lower wellbeing scores in comparison to those in non-rural locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lets produce our plots with a facet for rural vs non-rural residents:\n\nggplot(data = ruraldata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~isRural, labeller = \"label_both\") + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr instead of facets, we could use different colors for each location (rural vs non-rural):\n\nggplot(data = ruraldata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing, colour = isRural)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n    scale_colour_discrete(\n    name =\"Location\",\n    labels=c(\"Not Rural\", \"Rural\")) + \n    labs(x = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in non-rural locations appear to have higher wellbeing scores across almost all levels of social interactions. The slopes appear to be different for each location, where the greatest difference in wellbeing scores by location is most visible the highest number of social interactions. This suggests that there may be an interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know there might be an interaction?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lines in the two plots above do not run in parallel - this suggested the presence of an interaction. Specifically in our example, the non-parallel lines suggested an interaction effect based on location, as the number of social interactions did not appear to have the same influence on rural and non-rural residents’ wellbeing scores.\nHowever, the only way we can determine whether there is actually an interaction is by including an interaction term in our model, and testing this."

A significant conditional association was also evident between wellbeing and location \\((\\beta = -4.86,~ SE = 0.65,~ t(196) = -7.50,~ p &lt; .001)\\), which suggested that for those who have the average number of social interactions per week \\((M = 12.06)\\), wellbeing scores were 4.86 points lower for those in rural areas in comparison to those in non-rural.\nThe association between wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores) and social interactions was found to be dependent upon location (rural/non-rural), and this was significant \\((\\beta = -0.52,~ SE = 0.16,~ t(196) = -3.21, ~p = .002)\\). The expected increase in wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores) for every additional social interaction per week was 0.52 points less for those living in rural locations in comparison to those in non-rural. This interaction is visually presented in Figure 4. Therefore, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the association between wellbeing and social interactions is not moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area)."

Participants were also assessed on the Social Comparison Scale (SCS), which is an 11-item scale measuring self-perception (relative to others) of social rank, attractiveness and belonging, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) - a 21 item measure with higher scores indicating higher severity of symptoms. For both of these measures, only total scores were available. Items in the SCS were measured on a 5-point scale, giving minimum and maximum possible scores of 11 and 55 respectively. Items in the DASS-21 were measured on a 4-point scale, meaning that scores could range from 21 to 84.\nDensity plots and histograms will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of DASS-21 Scores, SCS Scores, and Neuroticism. To understand the strength of association among the variables, we will estimate the correlation coefficients; and to visualise these associations scatterplots will be used. To address the research question of whether Neuroticism moderated the effect of social comparison on depression and anxiety, we are going to fit the following interaction model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{DASS-21 Score} ~=~ & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{SCS Score} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Neuroticism} \\\\  \n& + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Neuroticism} \\cdot \\text{SCS Score}) + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\] Effects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_3 = 0\\)\nThe effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does not vary depending on level of Neuroticism.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0\\)\nThe effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does vary depending on level of Neuroticism."

Does it suggest an interaction?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than creating four separate plots, you might want to map some feature of the plot to the variable we created in the data, or make use of facet_wrap() / facet_grid().\nRemember that you can specify geom_smooth() to add a trend line. For a recap, review the facet examples contained within the visual exploration flashcards. Alternatively, review the numeric x numeric example - visualise data flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nggplot(data = scs_study, aes(x = scs, y = dass, col = zn_group)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', se = FALSE) +\n  facet_grid(~zn_group) +\n  labs(x = \"SCS Scores \", y = \"DASS-21 Scores\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") # removes the legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association between DASS-21 scores and SCS scores appears to be different across these groups. For those with a relatively high Neuroticism score, the association seems stronger, while for those with a low Neuroticism score there is almost no discernible association.\nThis does suggest an interaction - the association of DASS-21 ~ SCS differed across the values of Neuroticism.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising Interaction Terms\nCutting one of the explanatory variables up into groups essentially turns a numeric variable into a categorical one. We did this just to make it easier to visualise how an association differs across the values of another variable, because we can imagine a separate line for the association between SCS and DASS-21 scores for each of the groups of Neuroticism. However, in grouping a numeric variable like this we lose information. Neuroticism is measured on a continuous scale, and we want to capture how the association between SCS and DASS-21 differs across that continuum (rather than cutting it into chunks).\nWe could imagine cutting it into more and more chunks (see Figure 1), until what we end up with is an infinite number of lines - i.e., a three-dimensional plane/surface (recall that in for a multiple regression model with 2 explanatory variables, we can think of the model as having three-dimensions). The inclusion of the interaction term simply results in this surface no longer being necessarily flat. You can see this in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Separate regression lines DASS ~ SCS for Neuroticism when cut into 4 (left) or 6 (center) or 12 (right) groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 3D plot of regression surface with interaction.

The \\(F\\)-test for model utility was significant \\((F(3,652) = 48.50, p&lt;.001)\\), and the model explained approximately 17.87% of the variability in DASS-21 scores.\nThere was a significant conditional association between DASS-21 Scores and SCS scores (\\(Z\\)-scored) \\((\\beta = -1.57, SE = 0.24, p &lt; .001)\\), suggesting that for those with Neuroticism scores of 0, DASS-21 scores decreased by 1.57 for every 1 standard deviation increase in SCS scores.\nA significant conditional association was also evident between DASS-21 Scores and Neuroticism (\\(Z\\)-scored) \\((\\beta = 1.58, SE = 0.24, p &lt;.001)\\), suggesting that for those with SCS scores of 0, DASS-21 scores increased by 1.58 for every 1 standard deviation increase in Neuroticism.\nThe association between symptoms of depression and anxiety (DASS-21 scores) and social comparison was found to be dependent upon the level of Neuroticism, with a greater negative association between the two for those with higher levels of Neuroticism \\((\\beta = -1.83, SE = 0.23, p &lt;.001)\\). For every standard deviation increase in SCS Scores, the change in DASS-21 scores associated with an increase of 1 SD in Neuroticism was adjusted by -1.83. Thus, Neuroticism buffered the association between DASS-21 scores and SCS - this is visually displayed in Figure 3. We further used the Johnson-Neyman technique to probe the interaction, and to identify regions of significance. We identified that Neuroticism values (z-scored) outside the range of -1.28 to -0.55 were significant (see Figure 4).\nTherefore, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does not vary depending on level of Neuroticism)."

Participants were also assessed on the Social Comparison Scale (SCS), which is an 11-item scale measuring self-perception (relative to others) of social rank, attractiveness and belonging, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) - a 21 item measure with higher scores indicating higher severity of symptoms. For both of these measures, only total scores were available. Items in the SCS were measured on a 5-point scale, giving minimum and maximum possible scores of 11 and 55 respectively. Items in the DASS-21 were measured on a 4-point scale, meaning that scores could range from 21 to 84.\nDensity plots and histograms will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of DASS-21 Scores, SCS Scores, and Neuroticism. To understand the strength of association among the variables, we will estimate the correlation coefficients; and to visualise these associations scatterplots will be used. To address the research question of whether Neuroticism moderated the effect of social comparison on depression and anxiety, we are going to fit the following interaction model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{DASS-21 Score} ~=~ & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{SCS Score} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Neuroticism} \\\\  \n& + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Neuroticism} \\cdot \\text{SCS Score}) + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\] Effects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_3 = 0\\)\nThe effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does not vary depending on level of Neuroticism.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0\\)\nThe effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does vary depending on level of Neuroticism."

Does it suggest an interaction?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than creating four separate plots, you might want to map some feature of the plot to the variable we created in the data, or make use of facet_wrap() / facet_grid().\nRemember that you can specify geom_smooth() to add a trend line. For a recap, review the facet examples contained within the visual exploration flashcards. Alternatively, review the numeric x numeric example - visualise data flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nggplot(data = scs_study, aes(x = scs, y = dass, col = zn_group)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', se = FALSE) +\n  facet_grid(~zn_group) +\n  labs(x = \"SCS Scores \", y = \"DASS-21 Scores\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") # removes the legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association between DASS-21 scores and SCS scores appears to be different across these groups. For those with a relatively high Neuroticism score, the association seems stronger, while for those with a low Neuroticism score there is almost no discernible association.\nThis does suggest an interaction - the association of DASS-21 ~ SCS differed across the values of Neuroticism.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising Interaction Terms\nCutting one of the explanatory variables up into groups essentially turns a numeric variable into a categorical one. We did this just to make it easier to visualise how an association differs across the values of another variable, because we can imagine a separate line for the association between SCS and DASS-21 scores for each of the groups of Neuroticism. However, in grouping a numeric variable like this we lose information. Neuroticism is measured on a continuous scale, and we want to capture how the association between SCS and DASS-21 differs across that continuum (rather than cutting it into chunks).\nWe could imagine cutting it into more and more chunks (see Figure 1), until what we end up with is an infinite number of lines - i.e., a three-dimensional plane/surface (recall that in for a multiple regression model with 2 explanatory variables, we can think of the model as having three-dimensions). The inclusion of the interaction term simply results in this surface no longer being necessarily flat. You can see this in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Separate regression lines DASS ~ SCS for Neuroticism when cut into 4 (left) or 6 (center) or 12 (right) groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 3D plot of regression surface with interaction.

For every standard deviation increase in SCS Scores, the change in DASS-21 scores associated with an increase of 1 SD in Neuroticism was adjusted by -1.83. Thus, Neuroticism buffered the association between DASS-21 scores and SCS - this is visually displayed in Figure 3. We further used the Johnson-Neyman technique to probe the interaction, and to identify regions of significance. We identified that Neuroticism values (z-scored) outside the range of -1.28 to -0.55 were significant (see Figure 4).\nTherefore, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does not vary depending on level of Neuroticism)."

Participants belonged to one of three ‘Diagnosis’ groups, which had 10 participants in each - Control, Amnesic, or Huntingtons. Participants from each of the Diagnosis groups were randomly assigned to one of two ‘Tasks’ to measure different memory processes - Grammar or Recognition. For the purpose of this analysis, ‘Control’ was designated as the reference group for Diagnosis, since it was the only group of participants with no known neurological disorder, and as there is no natural reference group for Diagnosis, we chose to leave this as ‘Grammar’.\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among Diagnosis and Task conditions. To address the research question of whether the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will be greatest for Huntington patients in comparison to controls, we first need to define the dummy variables for both\nDiagnosis:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& D_\\text{Amnesic} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Amnesic} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad  \n\\\\\n& D_\\text{Huntingtons} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Huntingtons} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad  \n\\\\\n\\\\  \n& (\\text{Control is base level})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nand for Task:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Task is Recognition} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad\n\\\\\n\\\\\n& (\\text{Grammar is base level})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following interaction model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Score} &= \\beta_0 \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_4 \\cdot (\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} \\cdot \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition}) + \\beta_5 \\cdot (\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_5 = 0\\)\nThe difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks does not significantly differ between patients with Huntingtons in comparison to Controls.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_5 \\neq 0\\)\nThe difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks does significantly differ between patients with Huntingtons in comparison to Controls."

Participants belonged to one of three ‘Diagnosis’ groups, which had 10 participants in each - Control, Amnesic, or Huntingtons. Participants from each of the Diagnosis groups were randomly assigned to one of two ‘Tasks’ to measure different memory processes - Grammar or Recognition. For the purpose of this analysis, ‘Control’ was designated as the reference group for Diagnosis, since it was the only group of participants with no known neurological disorder, and as there is no natural reference group for Diagnosis, we chose to leave this as ‘Grammar’.\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among Diagnosis and Task conditions. To address the research question of whether the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will be greatest for Huntington patients in comparison to controls, we first need to define the dummy variables for both\nDiagnosis:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& D_\\text{Amnesic} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Amnesic} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad  \n\\\\\n& D_\\text{Huntingtons} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Huntingtons} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad  \n\\\\\n\\\\  \n& (\\text{Control is base level})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nand for Task:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Task is Recognition} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad\n\\\\\n\\\\\n& (\\text{Grammar is base level})\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following interaction model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Score} &= \\beta_0 \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_4 \\cdot (\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} \\cdot \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition}) + \\beta_5 \\cdot (\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot \\text{T}_\\text{Recognition})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_5 = 0\\)\nThe difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks does not significantly differ between patients with Huntingtons in comparison to Controls.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_5 \\neq 0\\)\nThe difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks does significantly differ between patients with Huntingtons in comparison to Controls."

Participants belonged to one of three ‘Diagnosis’ groups, which had 15 participants in each - Control, Amnesic, or Huntingtons. Participants from each of the Diagnosis groups were equally and randomly assigned to one of three ‘Tasks’ to measure different memory processes - Grammar, Classification, or Recognition - the former two measuring implicit memory and the latter explicit. This resulted in 5 participants from each Diagnosis group in each of the three Task conditions.\nAll participant data was complete, and categorical variables were coded as factors. For the purpose of this analysis, ‘Control’ was designated as the reference group for Diagnosis, since it was the only group of participants with no known neurological disorder. For Task, the recognition task measures explicit memory whereas the other two measure implicit memory, so this was specified as the reference group.\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among Diagnosis and Task conditions. To address the research question of whether the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will be greatest for Huntington patients in comparison to controls, we first need to define the dummy variables for both\nDiagnosis:\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Amnesic}\\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\\\  \n\\\\  \n\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Huntingtons}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad   \n\\\\  \n\\\\  \n(\\text{Control is base level})  \n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\nand for Task:\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}    \n\\text{T}_\\text{Grammar} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Task is Grammar}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\\\\  \n\\end{cases}\\\n\\\\  \n\\\\\n\\text{T}_\\text{Classification} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Task is Classification}\\\\   \n0 & \\text{otherwise}\\\\\n\\end{cases}\\\\\\  \n\\quad    \n\\\\    \n\\\\  \n(\\text{Recognition is base level})\\\\\n\\end{gather*}   \n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following interaction model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Interaction Model}: \\text{Score} &= \\beta_0  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} + \\beta_2 \\cdot  \\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Grammar}  + \\beta_4 \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Classification}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_5 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Grammar})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_6 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Grammar})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_7 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Classification})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_8 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Classification})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 5, 6, 7, 8\\))\nThere are no significant differences in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks for patients with different cognitive impairment(s).\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 5, 6, 7, 8\\))\nThere are significant differences in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks for patients with different cognitive impairment(s)."

At the 5% significance level, there was evidence that individuals with Amnesia and Huntingtons did differ in the difference between implicit and explicit memory tasks \\((t(36) = 5.40, p &lt; .001, \\text{two-sided})\\), and this difference was estimated to be 52.50. We are 95% confident that the difference in implicit and explicit memory scores between individuals with Amnesia and Huntingtons was between 32.80 to 72.20 points. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that the difference in differences was equal to zero."

    "text": "Study & Analysis Plan Overview\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nFirstly, examine the dataset, and perform any necessary and appropriate data management steps.\nNext, consider what would be the most appropriate coding constraint to apply in order to best address the research question - i.e., are we interested in whether group X (e.g., Amnesic) differed from group Y (e.g., Huntingtons), or whether group X (e.g., Amnesic) differed from the grand mean?\nChoose appropriate reference levels for the Diagnosis and Task variables based on your decision above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nData Management\n\nThe str() function will return the overall structure of the dataset, this can be quite handy to look at\n\nConvert categorical variables to factors, and if needed, provide better variable names*\n\nLabel factors appropriately to aid with your model interpretations if required*\n\nCheck that the dataset is complete (i.e., are there any NA values?). We can check this using is.na()\n\n\nNote that all of these steps can be done in combination - the mutate() and factor() functions will likely be useful here.\nCoding Constraints\n\nIf you think you’d benefit from a refresher on coding constraints, it might be best to revisit the materials from Semester 1 Block 2 (especially the dummy vs effects coding flashcard).\n\nIf you would like an overview of coding constraints in the context of interaction models, review the categorical x categorical example &gt; coding constraints flashcard.\n\nReference Levels\n\nReview the specifying reference levels flashcard.\n\n*See the numeric outcomes & categorical predictors flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nLet’s have a look at the data to see what we’re working with - str() or head() are a good place to start - and then we should check for any missing data (NA values):\n\n#first look at dataset structure\nstr(cog)\n\nspc_tbl_ [45 × 3] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Diagnosis: num [1:45] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Task     : num [1:45] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Y        : num [1:45] 44 63 76 72 45 72 66 55 82 75 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   Diagnosis = col_double(),\n  ..   Task = col_double(),\n  ..   Y = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n#now lets look at top 6 rows (or the head) of the dataset\nhead(cog)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Diagnosis  Task     Y\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1     1    44\n2         1     1    63\n3         1     1    76\n4         1     1    72\n5         1     1    45\n6         1     2    72\n\n#check for NAs \ntable(is.na(cog))\n\n\nFALSE \n  135 \n\n# there are none - all FALSE\n\nNext, lets convert Diagnosis and Task into factors, making the labels of each factor level more meaningful. According to the data description, the encoding of the factor Diagnosis is: 1 = amnesic patients, 2 = Huntingtons patients, and 3 = control patients. The encoding for the factor Task is: 1 = grammar task, 2 = classification task, and 3 = recognition task.\n\ncog &lt;- cog %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        Diagnosis = factor(Diagnosis, \n                           levels = c(1, 2, 3),\n                           labels = c('amnesic', 'huntingtons', 'control'),\n                           ordered = FALSE),\n        Task = factor(Task, \n                      levels = c(1, 2, 3),\n                      labels = c('grammar', 'classification', 'recognition'),\n                      ordered = FALSE)) %&gt;%\n    rename(Score = Y)\n\nSince we are interested in comparing groups, we should use dummy coding. By default, R uses dummy coding, so we do not need to make any changes to the coding constraint.\nHowever, for our reference groups, we’re likely to want it to be the Control group for Diagnosis, and recognition for Task:\n\ncog$Diagnosis &lt;- fct_relevel(cog$Diagnosis, \"control\")\ncog$Task &lt;- fct_relevel(cog$Task, \"recognition\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nProvide a brief overview of the study design and data, before detailing your analysis plan to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of the study (you might be able to re-use some of the content you wrote for Semester 2 Week 3 lab here, but note that we now have an extra condition within Task)\nOutline data checks / data cleaning\nState what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question\nSpecify the model to be fitted to address the research question (note that you will need to specify the reference level of your categorical variables. This will be somewhat similar to last week, but with the addition of Classification in Task, our model will contain a different number of parameters)\nSpecify your chosen significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) level\nState your hypotheses\n\nMuch of the information required can be found in the Study Overview codebook.\nThe statistical models flashcards may also be useful to refer to. Specifically the interaction models flashcards and categorical x categorical example flashcards might be of most use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe cog dataset contained information on 45 hypothetical participants from a between-subjects study. Participants belonged to one of three ‘Diagnosis’ groups, which had 15 participants in each - Control, Amnesic, or Huntingtons. Participants from each of the Diagnosis groups were equally and randomly assigned to one of three ‘Tasks’ to measure different memory processes - Grammar, Classification, or Recognition - the former two measuring implicit memory and the latter explicit. This resulted in 5 participants from each Diagnosis group in each of the three Task conditions.\nAll participant data was complete, and categorical variables were coded as factors. For the purpose of this analysis, ‘Control’ was designated as the reference group for Diagnosis, since it was the only group of participants with no known neurological disorder. For Task, the recognition task measures explicit memory whereas the other two measure implicit memory, so this was specified as the reference group.\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among Diagnosis and Task conditions. To address the research question of whether the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will be greatest for Huntington patients in comparison to controls, we first need to define the dummy variables for both\nDiagnosis:\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Amnesic}\\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\\\  \n\\\\  \n\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Huntingtons}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad   \n\\\\  \n\\\\  \n(\\text{Control is base level})  \n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\nand for Task:\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}    \n\\text{T}_\\text{Grammar} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Task is Grammar}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\\\\  \n\\end{cases}\\\n\\\\  \n\\\\\n\\text{T}_\\text{Classification} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Task is Classification}\\\\   \n0 & \\text{otherwise}\\\\\n\\end{cases}\\\\\\  \n\\quad    \n\\\\    \n\\\\  \n(\\text{Recognition is base level})\\\\\n\\end{gather*}   \n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following interaction model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Interaction Model}: \\text{Score} &= \\beta_0  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} + \\beta_2 \\cdot  \\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Grammar}  + \\beta_4 \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Classification}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_5 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Grammar})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_6 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Grammar})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_7 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Amnesic} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Classification})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_8 \\cdot  (\\text{D}_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot  \\text{T}_\\text{Classification})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 5, 6, 7, 8\\))\nThere are no significant differences in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks for patients with different cognitive impairment(s).\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 5, 6, 7, 8\\))\nThere are significant differences in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks for patients with different cognitive impairment(s)."

This corresponds to a contrast with coefficients of 0, 1, and −1, for control, amnesic, and Huntingtons, respectively.\nSimilarly, in terms of the tasks, we want to compare the average of the two implicit memory tasks with the explicit memory task. This corresponds to a contrast with coefficients of 0.5, 0.5, and −1 for the three tasks.\nWhen we are in presence of a significant interaction, the coefficients for a contrast between the means are found by multiplying each row coefficient with all column coefficients as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the coefficients to be used in the contrast analysis, and present in a table.\nNext, formally state the contrast that the researchers were interested in as testable hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an overview and example, review the manual contrasts flashcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nWe can specify the coefficients to be used in the contrast analysis in R using either:\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\n\n\ndiag_coef  &lt;- c('control' = 0, 'amnesic' = 1, 'huntingtons' = -1)\ntask_coef  &lt;- c('grammar' = 0.5, 'classification' = 0.5, 'recognition' = -1)\ncontr_coef &lt;- outer(diag_coef, task_coef)\ncontr_coef\n\n            grammar classification recognition\ncontrol         0.0            0.0           0\namnesic         0.5            0.5          -1\nhuntingtons    -0.5           -0.5           1\n\n\n\n\n\ndiag_coef  &lt;- c('control' = 0, 'amnesic' = 1, 'huntingtons' = -1)\ntask_coef  &lt;- c('grammar' = 0.5, 'classification' = 0.5, 'recognition' = -1)\ncontr_coef &lt;- diag_coef %o% task_coef\ncontr_coef\n\n            grammar classification recognition\ncontrol         0.0            0.0           0\namnesic         0.5            0.5          -1\nhuntingtons    -0.5           -0.5           1\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing either approach, we can then convert into a well-formatted table:\n\ncontr_coef %&gt;% \n    kable(., caption = \"Contrast Weights\") %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) \n\n\n\nTable 3: Contrast Weights\n\n\ngrammar\nclassification\nrecognition\n\n\n\ncontrol\n0.0\n0.0\n0\n\n\namnesic\n0.5\n0.5\n-1\n\n\nhuntingtons\n-0.5\n-0.5\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above coefficients correspond to the following hypotheses:\n\\[\nH_0: \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3} \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3} \\right) \\neq 0\n\\]\nwhich can be equivalently specified as:\n\\[\nH_0: \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\quad = \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3}\n\\]\n\\[  \nH_1: \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\quad \\neq \\quad  \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3}\n\\]\nboth statements state that, in the population, the difference between the mean implicit memory and the explicit memory score is the same for individuals with amnesia and Huntingtons.\nNote that the scores for the grammar and classification tasks have been averaged to obtain a single measure of ‘implicit memory’ score.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nFirstly, use emmeans() to obtain the estimated means and uncertainties for your factors.\nNext, specify the coefficients of the comparison and run the contrast analysis, obtaining 95% confidence intervals.\nReport the results of the contrast analysis in full.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an overview and example, review the manual contrasts flashcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nNow that we have the coefficients, let’s firstly call the emmeans function to get the estimated means of our groups (this is also helpful to look at the ordering of the groups):\n\ndiag_task_mean &lt;- emmeans(mdl_int, ~ Diagnosis*Task)\ndiag_task_mean\n\n Diagnosis   Task           emmean   SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n control     recognition        95 5.62 36     83.6    106.4\n amnesic     recognition        65 5.62 36     53.6     76.4\n huntingtons recognition        95 5.62 36     83.6    106.4\n control     grammar            80 5.62 36     68.6     91.4\n amnesic     grammar            60 5.62 36     48.6     71.4\n huntingtons grammar            40 5.62 36     28.6     51.4\n control     classification     80 5.62 36     68.6     91.4\n amnesic     classification     70 5.62 36     58.6     81.4\n huntingtons classification     45 5.62 36     33.6     56.4\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\nNext, from contr_coef, insert the coefficients following the order specified by the rows of diag_task_mean above. That is, the first one should be for control recognition and have a value of 0, the second for amnesic recognition with a value of -1, and so on…\nLet’s specify our weights, and give a name to this contrast (in this example ‘Research Hyp’):\n\ndiag_task_comp &lt;- contrast(diag_task_mean, \n                     method = list('Research Hyp' = c(0, -1, 1, 0, 0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, -0.5))\n                     )\n\nNext, let’s look at the output via one of two ways:\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\n\n\n#examine output\ndiag_task_comp\n\n contrast     estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Research Hyp     52.5 9.73 36   5.396  &lt;.0001\n\n#obtain confidence intervals\nconfint(diag_task_comp)\n\n contrast     estimate   SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n Research Hyp     52.5 9.73 36     32.8     72.2\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\n\n\n\n#examine summary output and state `infer = TRUE` to include confidence intervals\nsummary(diag_task_comp, infer = TRUE)\n\n contrast     estimate   SE df lower.CL upper.CL t.ratio p.value\n Research Hyp     52.5 9.73 36     32.8     72.2   5.396  &lt;.0001\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe performed a test against \\(H_0: \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\quad = \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3}\\). At the 5% significance level, there was evidence that individuals with Amnesia and Huntingtons did differ in the difference between implicit and explicit memory tasks \\((t(36) = 5.40, p &lt; .001, \\text{two-sided})\\), and this difference was estimated to be 52.50. We are 95% confident that the difference in implicit and explicit memory scores between individuals with Amnesia and Huntingtons was between 32.80 to 72.20 points. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that the difference in differences was equal to zero."

By not adjusting our \\(p\\)-value, we are increasing the experiment-wise Type I error rate - we could wrongly reject the null hypothesis at a much higher rate than 5/100 (or 1/20 as is assumed when \\(\\alpha = .05\\)). To overcome this, we might adjust and determine a result to be statistically significant if \\(p &lt; .005\\), as opposed to \\(p &lt; .05\\), depending on how many tests are in our family of tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\nSelect an appropriate method to adjust for multiple comparisons, and then obtain confidence intervals.\nComment on how these \\(p\\)-values differ from your raw (i.e., unadjusted) \\(p\\)-values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an overview, review the multiple comparisons flashcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nNote what the functions in R do is adjust the \\(p\\)-value, rather than the \\(\\alpha\\).\nSince we’re interested in all pairwise comparisons of means, the Tukey adjustment might be a sensible approach.

The downside, however, is that it may be overly conservative (i.e. reduce our power to detect an effect that is truly there)."

    "text": "Study Overview\n\nResearch Aim\nExplore the associations among study time and note-taking medium on test scores.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nRQ1: Do differences in test scores between study conditions differ by the note-taking medium used?\nRQ2: Are there differences in test scores between participants when comparing pairs of study and note-taking conditions? If so, what are these specific differences?\n\n\n\n Note Taking: Data Codebook\n\n\nDescription\nThe data used for this write-up exercise are simulated, drawing on a research paper that explored the association between student note taking, and performance when answering different types of questions. The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nMueller, P. A., & Oppenheimer, D. M. (2014). The pen is mightier than the keyboard: Advantages of longhand over laptop note taking. Psychological Science, 25(6), 1159–1168. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581\nIn the current study, participants were invited to take part in a study investigating the the medium of note taking and study time on test scores. The sample comprised of 160 students who took notes on a lecture via one of two mediums - either on a laptop or longhand (i.e., using pen and paper). After watching the lecture and taking notes, they then randomly allocated to one of four study time conditions, either engaging in no, minimal, moderate, or extensive study of the notes taken on their assigned medium. After engaging in study for their allocated time, participants took a test on the lecture content. The test involved a series of questions, where participants could score a maximum of 100 points.\nData Dictionary\nThe data in laptop_vs_longhand.csv contain three attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=160\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\ntest_score\nTest Score (0-100)\n\n\nmedium\nMedium of note-taking (levels = Longhand, Laptop)\n\n\nstudy\nStudy time (levels = No, Minimal, Moderate, Extensive)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntest_score\n      medium\n      study\n    \n\n\n47.47812\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n50.41772\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n49.88763\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n48.47961\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n48.44368\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n48.02715\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the laptop_vs_longhand dataset into R, assigning it to an object named notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(psych) \nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(interactions)\nlibrary(emmeans)\n\n#read in data\nnotes &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/laptop_vs_longhand.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Code\nTry to answer the research question above without referring to the provided analysis code below, and then check how your script matches up - is there anything you missed or done differently?

Remember, your analysis strategy should not contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:\n\nVery brief data and design description:\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\nSpecify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (e.g., for Likert scales), and how they are scored. If you have categorical data, you will need to specify the levels and coding of your variables, and what was specified as your reference level and the justification for this choice.\n\n\nData management:\n\nDescribe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\nAre there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many?\nDescribe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n\nModel specification:\n\nClearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\nWhat type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\nIn some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification.\nSpecify the model(s) to be fitted to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s). This includes specifying the type of coding scheme applied if using categorical data.\n* Specify the assumption and diagnostic checks that you will conduct. Specify what plots you will use, and how you will evaluate these.\n\n\n\n\n*Note, given time constraints in lab, we have not included any reference to diagnostic checks in this write-up example - you would be expected to include this in your report. You can find more information on diagnostic checks in the S1 Week 9 Lab and S1 Week 9 Lectures.\n\nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see Lesson 3 of the Rmd Bootcamp.\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\n\n\nThe notes dataset contained information on 160 participants who took part in a study concerning the role(s) of note taking and study time on test scores. Participants took notes on a lecture via one of two mediums - either on a laptop \\((n = 80)\\) or long-hand using pen and paper \\((n = 80)\\). They were then randomly allocated to one of four study time conditions, either engaging in no \\((n = 40)\\), minimal \\((n = 40)\\), moderate \\((n = 40)\\), or extensive \\((n = 40)\\) study of the notes taken on their assigned medium. Participants then answered a series of questions based on the lecture content. The maximum score was 100, where higher scores reflected better test performance.\nThe aim of this report was to address the following two research questions:\n\nDo differences in test scores between study conditions differ by the note-taking medium used?\nAre there differences in test scores between participants when comparing pairs of study and note-taking conditions? If so, what are these specific differences?\n\nAll participant data was complete, and test scores within range i.e., 0-100. Categorical variables were coded as factors, and dummy coding applied where ‘No’ was designated as the reference level for study condition, and ‘Longhand’ as the reference level for medium.\nTo address RQ1 and investigate whether study condition (No, Minimal, Moderate, Extensive) and note-taking medium (Longhand, Laptop) interacted to influence test scores, the following 4 \\(\\times\\) 2 model specification was used:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Test Score} &= \\beta_0  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{S}_\\text{Minimal} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{S}_\\text{Moderate} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{S}_\\text{Extensive} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop} \\\\        \n      &+ \\beta_5 \\cdot  (\\text{S}_\\text{Minimal} \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_6 \\cdot  (\\text{S}_\\text{Moderate} \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_7 \\cdot  (\\text{S}_\\text{Extensive} \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere we tested whether there was a significant interaction between study condition and note-taking medium:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{All}~~ \\beta_j = 0 ~\\text{(for j = 5, 6, 7)}\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\text{At least one}~ \\beta_j \\neq \\text{(for j = 5, 6, 7)}\n\\]\nEffects were considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\). As we were using between-subjects datasets, we assumed independence of our error terms. We assumed linearity as all predictor variables were categorical. Equal variances was assessed via partial residual plots (residuals should be evenly spread across the range of fitted values, where the spread should be constant across the range of fitted values), and normality was assessed via a qqplot of the residuals (points should follow along the diagonal line).\nTo address RQ2 and explore if there are pairwise differences and determine which conditions significantly differed from each other, we will conduct a series of pairwise comparisons. Since we are interested in all pairwise comparisons of means, we will apply a Tukey correction.\n\n\n\nAct II: Results\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults - What To Include*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy (including the evaluation of assumptions and diagnostics).\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and/or plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You do not want to overload the reader with unnecessary or duplicate information (e.g., do not present print outs of the head of a dataset, or the same information in tables and plots, etc.), and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can. You can also make use of an Appendix to present your assumption and diagnostic* plots/tables, but remember that you must evaluate these in-text within the results section and clearly refer the reader to the relevant plots within the Appendix.\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of any exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.\n\n*Note, given time constraints in lab, we have not included any reference to diagnostic checks in this write-up example - you would be expected to include this in your report. You can find more information on diagnostic checks in the S1 Week 9 Lab and S1 Week 9 Lectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Write-Up of Results Section\n\n\nDescriptive statistics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\n\nstudy\nmedium\nM_Score\nSD_Score\nSE_Score\nMin_Score\nMax_Score\n\n\n\nNo\nLonghand\n51.02\n2\n0.45\n48.02\n54.92\n\n\nNo\nLaptop\n48.12\n2\n0.45\n44.86\n51.16\n\n\nMinimal\nLonghand\n60.91\n2\n0.45\n57.84\n65.29\n\n\nMinimal\nLaptop\n55.57\n2\n0.45\n52.07\n60.10\n\n\nModerate\nLonghand\n80.69\n2\n0.45\n76.34\n84.64\n\n\nModerate\nLaptop\n59.30\n2\n0.45\n55.77\n62.98\n\n\nExtensive\nLonghand\n90.58\n2\n0.45\n86.82\n94.32\n\n\nExtensive\nLaptop\n61.16\n2\n0.45\n56.93\n64.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the No and Minimal study conditions, there did not appear to be differences in test score between those using a laptop or longhand when note-taking. However, those in the longhand note-taking condition scored higher than those using laptops in the moderate and extensive study conditions. This suggested that there may be an interaction (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Association between Test Score and Medium / Study Conditions\n\n\n\nTest scores were analysed with a 4 (study: no vs minimal vs moderate vs extensive) \\(\\times\\) 2 (medium: longhand vs laptop) categorical interaction model.\nThe model met assumptions of linearity and independence (see Appendix A, top left panel of Figure 4; residuals were randomly scattered with a mean of zero and there was no clear dependence), homoscedasticity (see Appendix A, bottom left panel of Figure 4; there was a constant spread of residuals), and normality (see Appendix A, top right panel of Figure 4; the QQplot showed very little deviation from the diagonal line).\nThere was a significant interaction between study condition and note-taking medium \\(F(7, 152) = 1081, p &lt; . 001\\). Full regression results, including 95% Confidence Intervals, are shown in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: RQ1 - Regression Table for Total Scores Model\n\n\n \ntest score\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\nIntercept\n51.02\n50.14 – 51.90\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Minimal\n9.89\n8.64 – 11.14\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Moderate\n29.67\n28.42 – 30.92\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Extensive\n39.56\n38.31 – 40.81\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nMedium - Laptop\n-2.90\n-4.15 – -1.65\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Minimal : Medium - Laptop\n-2.44\n-4.21 – -0.67\n0.007\n\n\nStudy - Moderate : Medium - Laptop\n-18.49\n-20.26 – -16.72\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Extensive : Medium - Laptop\n-26.52\n-28.29 – -24.75\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n160\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.980 / 0.979\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs displayed in Figure 2, results suggested that the difference in scores did differ significantly across the note-taking medium and study conditions, where scores differences appeared to get larger as the period of study increased (i.e., there was little difference between longhand and laptop note-taking conditions when participants engaged in no study, but the gap in test scores seemed to grow as the length of study time increased).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Interaction Plot\n\n\n\nTo explore the interaction further, and address RQ2, pairwise comparisons were conducted. Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference comparisons (see Figure 3) indicated that the vast majority of pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. There were only three pairs of comparisons that were not - those in the minimal longhand condition did not significantly differ from those in either the moderate laptop (95% CI [-0.33 - 3.55]) or extensive laptop (95% CI [-2.19 - 1.69]) conditions; and there was no difference between those in the laptop condition who studied either for a moderate or extensive period of time (95% CI [-3.80 - 0.08]). Overall, test differences appeared more pronounced when using the longhand note-taking medium across study conditions.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Tukey HSD Pairwise Comparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct III: Discussion\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - What To Include\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question.\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\n\n\nThe findings indicated that, in general, people who engaged in no study regardless of note-taking medium performed at chance level. Overall, participants who had taken notes with laptops performed worse on tests regardless of study time in comparison to those who took notes by hand. Our results led us to reject the null hypothesis, as the results indicated that the association between study condition and note-taking medium did interact to influence test scores. The direction of this association was somewhat surprising, as it suggested that laptop use can negatively influence performance on educational tests, and that engaging in hours of study is not enough to mitigate these effects.\n\n\n\nAssumptions & Diagnostics Appendix\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nGiven that the report should be kept as concise as possible, you may wish to utilize the appendix to present assumption and diagnostic plots. You must however ensure that you have:\n\nDescribed what assumptions you will check in the analysis strategy, including how you will evaluate them.\nSummarized the evaluations of your assumptions and diagnostic checks in the results section of the main report.\nAccurately referred to the figures and tables labels presented in the appendix in the main report (if you don’t refer to them, the reader won’t know what they are relevant to!).\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Assumptions & Diagnostics Appendix\n\n\nAppendix A\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Assumption Plots"

The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nMueller, P. A., & Oppenheimer, D. M. (2014). The pen is mightier than the keyboard: Advantages of longhand over laptop note taking. Psychological Science, 25(6), 1159–1168. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581\nIn the current study, participants were invited to take part in a study investigating the the medium of note taking and study time on test scores. The sample comprised of 160 students who took notes on a lecture via one of two mediums - either on a laptop or longhand (i.e., using pen and paper). After watching the lecture and taking notes, they then randomly allocated to one of four study time conditions, either engaging in no, minimal, moderate, or extensive study of the notes taken on their assigned medium. After engaging in study for their allocated time, participants took a test on the lecture content. The test involved a series of questions, where participants could score a maximum of 100 points.\nData Dictionary\nThe data in laptop_vs_longhand.csv contain three attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=160\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\ntest_score\nTest Score (0-100)\n\n\nmedium\nMedium of note-taking (levels = Longhand, Laptop)\n\n\nstudy\nStudy time (levels = No, Minimal, Moderate, Extensive)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntest_score\n      medium\n      study\n    \n\n\n47.47812\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n50.41772\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n49.88763\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n48.47961\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n48.44368\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n48.02715\nLaptop\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the laptop_vs_longhand dataset into R, assigning it to an object named notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(psych) \nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(interactions)\nlibrary(emmeans)\n\n#read in data\nnotes &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/laptop_vs_longhand.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Code\nTry to answer the research question above without referring to the provided analysis code below, and then check how your script matches up - is there anything you missed or done differently?

Remember, your analysis strategy should not contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:\n\nVery brief data and design description:\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\nSpecify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (e.g., for Likert scales), and how they are scored. If you have categorical data, you will need to specify the levels and coding of your variables, and what was specified as your reference level and the justification for this choice.\n\n\nData management:\n\nDescribe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\nAre there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many?\nDescribe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n\nModel specification:\n\nClearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\nWhat type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\nIn some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification.\nSpecify the model(s) to be fitted to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s). This includes specifying the type of coding scheme applied if using categorical data.\n* Specify the assumption and diagnostic checks that you will conduct. Specify what plots you will use, and how you will evaluate these.\n\n\n\n\n*Note, given time constraints in lab, we have not included any reference to diagnostic checks in this write-up example - you would be expected to include this in your report. You can find more information on diagnostic checks in the S1 Week 9 Lab and S1 Week 9 Lectures.\n\nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see Lesson 3 of the Rmd Bootcamp.\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\n\n\nThe notes dataset contained information on 160 participants who took part in a study concerning the role(s) of note taking and study time on test scores. Participants took notes on a lecture via one of two mediums - either on a laptop \\((n = 80)\\) or long-hand using pen and paper \\((n = 80)\\). They were then randomly allocated to one of four study time conditions, either engaging in no \\((n = 40)\\), minimal \\((n = 40)\\), moderate \\((n = 40)\\), or extensive \\((n = 40)\\) study of the notes taken on their assigned medium. Participants then answered a series of questions based on the lecture content. The maximum score was 100, where higher scores reflected better test performance.\nThe aim of this report was to address the following two research questions:\n\nDo differences in test scores between study conditions differ by the note-taking medium used?\nAre there differences in test scores between participants when comparing pairs of study and note-taking conditions? If so, what are these specific differences?\n\nAll participant data was complete, and test scores within range i.e., 0-100. Categorical variables were coded as factors, and dummy coding applied where ‘No’ was designated as the reference level for study condition, and ‘Longhand’ as the reference level for medium.\nTo address RQ1 and investigate whether study condition (No, Minimal, Moderate, Extensive) and note-taking medium (Longhand, Laptop) interacted to influence test scores, the following 4 \\(\\times\\) 2 model specification was used:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Test Score} &= \\beta_0  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{S}_\\text{Minimal} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{S}_\\text{Moderate} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{S}_\\text{Extensive} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop} \\\\        \n      &+ \\beta_5 \\cdot  (\\text{S}_\\text{Minimal} \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_6 \\cdot  (\\text{S}_\\text{Moderate} \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_7 \\cdot  (\\text{S}_\\text{Extensive} \\cdot \\text{M}_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere we tested whether there was a significant interaction between study condition and note-taking medium:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{All}~~ \\beta_j = 0 ~\\text{(for j = 5, 6, 7)}\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\text{At least one}~ \\beta_j \\neq \\text{(for j = 5, 6, 7)}\n\\]\nEffects were considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\). As we were using between-subjects datasets, we assumed independence of our error terms. We assumed linearity as all predictor variables were categorical. Equal variances was assessed via partial residual plots (residuals should be evenly spread across the range of fitted values, where the spread should be constant across the range of fitted values), and normality was assessed via a qqplot of the residuals (points should follow along the diagonal line).\nTo address RQ2 and explore if there are pairwise differences and determine which conditions significantly differed from each other, we will conduct a series of pairwise comparisons. Since we are interested in all pairwise comparisons of means, we will apply a Tukey correction.\n\n\n\nAct II: Results\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults - What To Include*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy (including the evaluation of assumptions and diagnostics).\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and/or plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You do not want to overload the reader with unnecessary or duplicate information (e.g., do not present print outs of the head of a dataset, or the same information in tables and plots, etc.), and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can. You can also make use of an Appendix to present your assumption and diagnostic* plots/tables, but remember that you must evaluate these in-text within the results section and clearly refer the reader to the relevant plots within the Appendix.\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of any exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.\n\n*Note, given time constraints in lab, we have not included any reference to diagnostic checks in this write-up example - you would be expected to include this in your report. You can find more information on diagnostic checks in the S1 Week 9 Lab and S1 Week 9 Lectures.\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Write-Up of Results Section\n\n\nDescriptive statistics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\n\nstudy\nmedium\nM_Score\nSD_Score\nSE_Score\nMin_Score\nMax_Score\n\n\n\nNo\nLonghand\n51.02\n2\n0.45\n48.02\n54.92\n\n\nNo\nLaptop\n48.12\n2\n0.45\n44.86\n51.16\n\n\nMinimal\nLonghand\n60.91\n2\n0.45\n57.84\n65.29\n\n\nMinimal\nLaptop\n55.57\n2\n0.45\n52.07\n60.10\n\n\nModerate\nLonghand\n80.69\n2\n0.45\n76.34\n84.64\n\n\nModerate\nLaptop\n59.30\n2\n0.45\n55.77\n62.98\n\n\nExtensive\nLonghand\n90.58\n2\n0.45\n86.82\n94.32\n\n\nExtensive\nLaptop\n61.16\n2\n0.45\n56.93\n64.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the No and Minimal study conditions, there did not appear to be differences in test score between those using a laptop or longhand when note-taking. However, those in the longhand note-taking condition scored higher than those using laptops in the moderate and extensive study conditions. This suggested that there may be an interaction (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Association between Test Score and Medium / Study Conditions\n\n\n\nTest scores were analysed with a 4 (study: no vs minimal vs moderate vs extensive) \\(\\times\\) 2 (medium: longhand vs laptop) categorical interaction model.\nThe model met assumptions of linearity and independence (see Appendix A, top left panel of Figure 4; residuals were randomly scattered with a mean of zero and there was no clear dependence), homoscedasticity (see Appendix A, bottom left panel of Figure 4; there was a constant spread of residuals), and normality (see Appendix A, top right panel of Figure 4; the QQplot showed very little deviation from the diagonal line).\nThere was a significant interaction between study condition and note-taking medium \\(F(7, 152) = 1081, p &lt; . 001\\).

Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference comparisons (see Figure 3) indicated that the vast majority of pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. There were only three pairs of comparisons that were not - those in the minimal longhand condition did not significantly differ from those in either the moderate laptop (95% CI [-0.33 - 3.55]) or extensive laptop (95% CI [-2.19 - 1.69]) conditions; and there was no difference between those in the laptop condition who studied either for a moderate or extensive period of time (95% CI [-3.80 - 0.08]). Overall, test differences appeared more pronounced when using the longhand note-taking medium across study conditions.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Tukey HSD Pairwise Comparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct III: Discussion\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - What To Include\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question.\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\n\n\nThe findings indicated that, in general, people who engaged in no study regardless of note-taking medium performed at chance level. Overall, participants who had taken notes with laptops performed worse on tests regardless of study time in comparison to those who took notes by hand. Our results led us to reject the null hypothesis, as the results indicated that the association between study condition and note-taking medium did interact to influence test scores. The direction of this association was somewhat surprising, as it suggested that laptop use can negatively influence performance on educational tests, and that engaging in hours of study is not enough to mitigate these effects.\n\n\n\nAssumptions & Diagnostics Appendix\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nGiven that the report should be kept as concise as possible, you may wish to utilize the appendix to present assumption and diagnostic plots. You must however ensure that you have:\n\nDescribed what assumptions you will check in the analysis strategy, including how you will evaluate them.\nSummarized the evaluations of your assumptions and diagnostic checks in the results section of the main report.\nAccurately referred to the figures and tables labels presented in the appendix in the main report (if you don’t refer to them, the reader won’t know what they are relevant to!).\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution : Example Assumptions & Diagnostics Appendix\n\n\nAppendix A\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Assumption Plots"

It is impossible to judge how many participants would be required to detect a small effect size (green line) - we would suggest that they conduct their own power calculation as it is too difficult to judge based on the figure alone.\nGenerally, if they want to be able to detect a medium-large effect with 90% power using \\(\\alpha = .05\\), it appears that there is little gain in recruiting a sample size &gt; ~110. However, if they want to be able to detect a small effect with 90% power using \\(\\alpha = .05\\), they are likely going to require a very large sample size.\nTo summarise the association between effect size and sample size, it appears that the smaller the effect you are trying to detect, the larger the sample size you will require."

Participants were aged 18-75 years old, and were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups (exciting - 1-hour long roller-coaster session; or relaxing - 1-hour long meditation session) before completing a free-recall test (% correct).\nThe ‘group’ variable denoting which intervention type participants were allocated to was coded as a factor with two levels - ‘rollercoaster’ and ‘meditation’, where ‘rollercoaster’ was designated as the reference group. There were no NAs contained within the dataset, and recall scores were within range (i.e., within possible values of 0-100), as were ages (i.e., all ages ranged from 18-75).\nTo address the research question of whether age and intervention type influence recall, we can specify our model as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Recall} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Age}  + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Intervention Group}_{\\text{Meditation}} + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Age} \\cdot \\text{Intervention Group}_{\\text{Meditation}}) + \\epsilon\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\).\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_3 = 0\\)\nThe association between recall and age does not differ by intervention type.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0\\)\nThe association between recall and age does differ by intervention type."

It is impossible to judge how many participants would be required to detect a small effect size (green line) - we would suggest that they conduct their own power calculation as it is too difficult to judge based on the figure alone.\nGenerally, if they want to be able to detect a medium-large effect with 90% power using \\(\\alpha = .05\\), it appears that there is little gain in recruiting a sample size &gt; ~110. However, if they want to be able to detect a small effect with 90% power using \\(\\alpha = .05\\), they are likely going to require a very large sample size.\nTo summarise the association between effect size and sample size, it appears that the smaller the effect you are trying to detect, the larger the sample size you will require."

Consider:\n\nDo you want BAC on the current scale, or could you transform it somehow? Consider that instead of the coefficient representing the difference when moving from 0% to 1% BAC (1% blood alcohol is fatal!), we might want to have the difference associated with 0% to 0.01% BAC (i.e, a we want to talk about effects in terms of changing 1/100th of a percentage of BAC)\nDo you want age to be centred at 0 years (as it currently is), or could you re-centre to make it more meaningful?\nIn your data management, you will hopefully make condition a factor, but have you considered the reference level? It would likely make most sense for this to be set as “Low”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe str() function will return the overall structure of the dataset, this can be quite handy to look at.\nWhen considering the scale of your BAC and age variables, review the data transformation flashcards.\n\nData Management - Convert categorical variables to factors, and if needed, provide better variable names - Label factors appropriately to aid with your model interpretations if required\n- Check that the dataset is complete (i.e., are there any NA values?). We can check this using is.na()\nNote that all of these steps can be done in combination - the mutate() and factor() functions will likely be useful here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s examine the data:\n\n#look at structure of data\nstr(drunkdoor)\n\nspc_tbl_ [120 × 5] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ id       : chr [1:120] \"ID1\" \"ID2\" \"ID3\" \"ID4\" ...\n $ bac      : num [1:120] 0.06744 0.00331 0.00323 0.07984 0.06676 ...\n $ age      : num [1:120] 43 64 44 67 62 45 50 45 48 61 ...\n $ condition: chr [1:120] \"Low\" \"Low\" \"Low\" \"High\" ...\n $ notice   : num [1:120] 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   id = col_character(),\n  ..   bac = col_double(),\n  ..   age = col_double(),\n  ..   condition = col_character(),\n  ..   notice = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n#check for NAs - there are none - all FALSE\ntable(is.na(drunkdoor))\n\n\nFALSE \n  600 \n\n\nNext we need to specify Condition as a factor, and set ‘Low’ as the reference group:\n\n#re-assign categorical IVs as factors\ndrunkdoor$condition &lt;- factor(drunkdoor$condition,\n                              levels = c(\"Low\", \"High\"))\n\n\n#set 'low' as reference group\ndrunkdoor$condition &lt;- fct_relevel(drunkdoor$condition, \"Low\")\n\nIt may be more useful to have blood alcohol (BAC) in terms of 100ths of percentages, rather than percentages, for the reasons noted above. It would also be more useful for interpretation to have age centered on the mean (note that this won’t change anything other than the intercept in our model). Let’s make both these changes:\n\ndrunkdoor &lt;- drunkdoor %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    bac100 = bac*100,\n    age_mc = age - mean(age)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nProvide a brief overview of the study design and data, before detailing your analysis plan to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of the study\nState what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question\nSpecify the model to be fitted to address the research question (note that you will need to specify the reference level of your categorical variable)\nSpecify your chosen significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) level\nState your hypotheses\n\nMuch of the information required can be found in the Study Overview codebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drunkdoor dataset contained information on 120 hypothetical participants who were approached within the vicinity of a number of establishments with licenses to sell alcohol to be consumed on-premises. Using a between-subjects design experimental design, experimenters manipulated perceptual load in two ways (door appearance and number of papers held by experimenters) to create low- and high-load conditions. In the low-load condition, the door was a standard MDF construction painted in a neutral grey, and the experimenters handled only 2 sheets of paper which had minimal printed text. In the high-load condition, the door was painted with detailed graffiti and had numerous pieces of paper and notices attached to the side facing the participants, and the experimenters held a pile of 30 papers containing drawings and printed text. Experimenters recorded whether or not participants noticed the mid-conversation experimenter swap (no = 0, yes = 1). The researchers also collected information on participants’ blood alcohol level (BAC; percentage of alcohol in an individual’s blood stream) and age (in years).\nTo aid with interpretation, age was mean centered. The BAC measure was also transformed to represent a one-unit change as 0.01%, as opposed to 1%. Low-load was specified as the reference group of the perceptual load condition.\nDensity plots and bar plots will be used to individually visualise the associations between whether the mid-conversation swap was noticed and BAC, age, and condition.\nTo investigate whether the probability of noticing the swap differed as a function of age, BAC, and perceptual load, a binary logistic regression model was used, where the following model was specified:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ln \\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) ~=~ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Age + \\beta_2 \\cdot BAC + \\beta_3 \\cdot Condition_{High}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}~{p}~ &=~ \\text{probability of noticing the mid-conversation swap}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nSusceptibility to change blindness is not influenced by age, level of alcohol intoxication, or perceptual load.\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nSusceptibility to change blindness is influenced by age, level of alcohol intoxication, and/or perceptual load.\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\)."

Have a 130% probability of noticing the swap?\nNeither of these interpretations are quite right - participants could only notice one swap, and probability is between 0 and 1.\nTherefore, it seems that we cannot capture this as a linear relationship - we instead need a logistic regression model."

    "section": "Study & Analysis Plan Overview",
    "text": "Study & Analysis Plan Overview\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nFirstly, examine the dataset, and perform any necessary and appropriate data management steps.\nNext, think about the scales that the variables are currently on, with a particular focus on BAC, age, and condition. Consider:\n\nDo you want BAC on the current scale, or could you transform it somehow? Consider that instead of the coefficient representing the difference when moving from 0% to 1% BAC (1% blood alcohol is fatal!), we might want to have the difference associated with 0% to 0.01% BAC (i.e, a we want to talk about effects in terms of changing 1/100th of a percentage of BAC)\nDo you want age to be centred at 0 years (as it currently is), or could you re-centre to make it more meaningful?\nIn your data management, you will hopefully make condition a factor, but have you considered the reference level? It would likely make most sense for this to be set as “Low”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe str() function will return the overall structure of the dataset, this can be quite handy to look at.\nWhen considering the scale of your BAC and age variables, review the data transformation flashcards.\n\nData Management - Convert categorical variables to factors, and if needed, provide better variable names - Label factors appropriately to aid with your model interpretations if required\n- Check that the dataset is complete (i.e., are there any NA values?). We can check this using is.na()\nNote that all of these steps can be done in combination - the mutate() and factor() functions will likely be useful here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nLet’s examine the data:\n\n#look at structure of data\nstr(drunkdoor)\n\nspc_tbl_ [120 × 5] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ id       : chr [1:120] \"ID1\" \"ID2\" \"ID3\" \"ID4\" ...\n $ bac      : num [1:120] 0.06744 0.00331 0.00323 0.07984 0.06676 ...\n $ age      : num [1:120] 43 64 44 67 62 45 50 45 48 61 ...\n $ condition: chr [1:120] \"Low\" \"Low\" \"Low\" \"High\" ...\n $ notice   : num [1:120] 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   id = col_character(),\n  ..   bac = col_double(),\n  ..   age = col_double(),\n  ..   condition = col_character(),\n  ..   notice = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n#check for NAs - there are none - all FALSE\ntable(is.na(drunkdoor))\n\n\nFALSE \n  600 \n\n\nNext we need to specify Condition as a factor, and set ‘Low’ as the reference group:\n\n#re-assign categorical IVs as factors\ndrunkdoor$condition &lt;- factor(drunkdoor$condition,\n                              levels = c(\"Low\", \"High\"))\n\n\n#set 'low' as reference group\ndrunkdoor$condition &lt;- fct_relevel(drunkdoor$condition, \"Low\")\n\nIt may be more useful to have blood alcohol (BAC) in terms of 100ths of percentages, rather than percentages, for the reasons noted above. It would also be more useful for interpretation to have age centered on the mean (note that this won’t change anything other than the intercept in our model). Let’s make both these changes:\n\ndrunkdoor &lt;- drunkdoor %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    bac100 = bac*100,\n    age_mc = age - mean(age)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nProvide a brief overview of the study design and data, before detailing your analysis plan to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of the study\nState what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question\nSpecify the model to be fitted to address the research question (note that you will need to specify the reference level of your categorical variable)\nSpecify your chosen significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) level\nState your hypotheses\n\nMuch of the information required can be found in the Study Overview codebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe drunkdoor dataset contained information on 120 hypothetical participants who were approached within the vicinity of a number of establishments with licenses to sell alcohol to be consumed on-premises. Using a between-subjects design experimental design, experimenters manipulated perceptual load in two ways (door appearance and number of papers held by experimenters) to create low- and high-load conditions. In the low-load condition, the door was a standard MDF construction painted in a neutral grey, and the experimenters handled only 2 sheets of paper which had minimal printed text. In the high-load condition, the door was painted with detailed graffiti and had numerous pieces of paper and notices attached to the side facing the participants, and the experimenters held a pile of 30 papers containing drawings and printed text. Experimenters recorded whether or not participants noticed the mid-conversation experimenter swap (no = 0, yes = 1). The researchers also collected information on participants’ blood alcohol level (BAC; percentage of alcohol in an individual’s blood stream) and age (in years).\nTo aid with interpretation, age was mean centered. The BAC measure was also transformed to represent a one-unit change as 0.01%, as opposed to 1%. Low-load was specified as the reference group of the perceptual load condition.\nDensity plots and bar plots will be used to individually visualise the associations between whether the mid-conversation swap was noticed and BAC, age, and condition.\nTo investigate whether the probability of noticing the swap differed as a function of age, BAC, and perceptual load, a binary logistic regression model was used, where the following model was specified:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ln \\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) ~=~ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Age + \\beta_2 \\cdot BAC + \\beta_3 \\cdot Condition_{High}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}~{p}~ &=~ \\text{probability of noticing the mid-conversation swap}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nSusceptibility to change blindness is not influenced by age, level of alcohol intoxication, or perceptual load.\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nSusceptibility to change blindness is influenced by age, level of alcohol intoxication, and/or perceptual load.\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\)."

Visually following the line from the plot produced below, what do you think the predicted model value would be for someone who is aged 30? What does this value mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nHopefully you can see that the model predicted value for someone aged 30 is approximately 1.30.\nBut let’s pause to contemplate what this means, keeping in mind the way in which the ‘Notice’ variable was measured (i.e., no = 0, yes = 1).\nDoes this mean then that a 30 year old participant will… Notice 1.30 experimenter-swaps? Have a 130% probability of noticing the swap?\nNeither of these interpretations are quite right - participants could only notice one swap, and probability is between 0 and 1.\nTherefore, it seems that we cannot capture this as a linear relationship - we instead need a logistic regression model."

See Table 2 for full model results, and Figure 5 for a visualisation of the model estimates and confidence intervals.\nAge was found to be associated with susceptibility to change-blindness, where for every one year increase in age, the odds of a person noticing the mid-conversation swap decreased, with \\(odds = 0.8\\) (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\, [0.73, 0.86]\\)), after accounting for differences in blood alcohol levels and perceptual load.\nIn contrary to what might have been expected, change-blindness appeared to decrease with higher alcohol intoxication, where for every 1/100th of a percentage increase in blood alcohol content, there were 1.42 times (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\,[1.15, 1.79]\\)) increased odds of noticing the swap when holding age and perceptual load constant.\nAfter accounting for age and blood alcohol levels, the odds of noticing the swap were significantly different depending upon the perceptual load. For those with a high perceptual load, the odds of noticing a swap decreased by a factor of 0.2 (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\,[0.07, 0.56]\\)).\nIn summary, older age increased the susceptibility to change blindness, high perceptual load was found to decrease the odds of people being blind to change, and increased levels of alcohol intoxication appeared to be associated with greater odds of noticing change."

The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nMischel, W., Ebbesen, E. B., & Raskoff Zeiss, A. (1972). Cognitive and attentional mechanisms in delay of gratification. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 21(2), 204–218. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032198\nIn the current study, a sample of 304 children, ranging in ages from 3 to 10 years old, took part. Each child was shown a marshmallow, and it was explained that they were about to be left alone for 10 minutes. They were told that they were welcome to eat the marshmallow while they were waiting, but if the marshmallow was still there after 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows.\nFor half of the children who took part, the marshmallow was visible for the entire 10 minutes (or until they ate it!). For the other half, the marshmallow was placed under a plastic cup.\nThe experiment took part at various times throughout the working day, and researchers were worried about children being more hungry at certain times of day, so they kept track of whether each child completed the task in the morning or the afternoon, so that they could control for this in their analyses.\nFor an example of the marshmallow experiment, watch the following video:\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary\nThe data in mallow2.csv contain five attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=304\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nname\nParticipant name\n\n\nagemonths\nAge (in months)\n\n\ntimeofday\nTime of day that the experiment took place ('am' = morning, 'pm' = afternoon)\n\n\nvisibility\nExperimental condition - whether the marshmallow was 'visible' or 'hidden' for the 10 minutes\n\n\ntaken\nWhether or not the participant took ('taken') the marshmallow within the 10 minutes or left it ('waited')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n      agemonths\n      timeofday\n      visibility\n      taken\n    \n\n\nLauren\n60\npm\nvisible\ntaken\n\n\nTaraleah\n100\npm\nvisible\nwaited\n\n\nConnor\n109\npm\nvisible\nwaited\n\n\nSiengthong\n61\npm\nhidden\nwaited\n\n\nNaseem\n90\npm\nhidden\nwaited\n\n\nMartin\n636\nam\nhidden\ntaken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the mallow2 dataset into R, assigning it to an object named marshmallow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych) \nlibrary(sjPlot)\n\n#read in data\nmarshmallow &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Code\nTry to answer the research question above without referring to the provided analysis code below, and then check how your script matches up - is there anything you missed or done differently?

Remember, your analysis strategy should not contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:\n\nVery brief data and design description:\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\nSpecify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (e.g., for Likert scales), and how they are scored. If you have categorical data, you will need to specify the levels and coding of your variables, and what was specified as your reference level and the justification for this choice.\n\n\nData management:\n\nDescribe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\nAre there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many?\nDescribe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n\nModel specification:\n\nClearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\nWhat type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\nIn some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification.\nSpecify the model(s) to be fitted to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s). This includes specifying the type of coding scheme applied if using categorical data.\nSpecify the assumption and diagnostic checks that you will conduct. Specify what plots you will use, and how you will evaluate these.\n\n\n\nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see Lesson 3 of the Rmd Bootcamp.\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\n\n\nThe mallow2 dataset contained information on 304 participants who took part in a study concerning delayed gratification - where children were presented with a single marshmallow, but were told that if they could leave it for 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows (scored dichotomously as taken or waited). The children participated in either the morning (am) or afternoon (pm), and the marshmallow was either visible or hidden for the 10 minute duration of the experiment. The age of each child was also recorded. All participant data was complete (no missing values), but two participants were excluded due to their age being outside of the range included in the study, and so the final sample size was 302.\nTo investigate whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day (am/pm), age, and marshmallow visibility (visible/hidden), a binary logistic regression model was used. Effects were considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\). The following model specification was used:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_1 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Time of day}_{PM} +  \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Visibility}_{Hidden}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}~{p}~ &=~ \\text{probability of taking the marshmallow}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo address the research question of whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility, this formally corresponded to:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{All} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ = ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\text{At least one} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ \\neq ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n\\]\nTo assess model fit, we visually assessed the standardized deviance residuals and Cook’s Distance. We expected the former to identify outliers (or extreme values), and we expected residuals to fall within the range of -2 to 2. We used the latter to check for influential observations, and visually assessed if any of our 302 observations had a Cook’s distance &gt; 0.5 (moderately influential) or &gt; 1 (highly influential).\n\n\n\nAct II: Results\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults - What To Include\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy (including the evaluation of assumptions and diagnostics).\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and/or plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You do not want to overload the reader with unnecessary or duplicate information (e.g., do not present print outs of the head of a dataset, or the same information in tables and plots, etc.), and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can. You can also make use of an Appendix to present your assumption and diagnostic* plots/tables, but remember that you must evaluate these in-text within the results section and clearly refer the reader to the relevant plots within the Appendix.\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of any exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Results Section\n\n\nDescriptive statistics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\n\nvisibility\ntimeofday\nM_Age\nSD_Age\npercent_taken\n\n\n\nvisible\nam\n7.17\n1.69\n52.70\n\n\nvisible\npm\n6.04\n1.78\n59.21\n\n\nhidden\nam\n7.47\n1.72\n28.57\n\n\nhidden\npm\n5.71\n1.71\n37.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appeared that when the marshmallow was visible, a greater percentage of children took it; and the percentage of children who engaged in delayed gratification was higher in the morning sessions (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Association between Delayed Gratification, Age, Visibility of Marshmallow, and Time of Day\n\n\n\nA binary logistic regression model was fitted to determine whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility.\nOur model did not raise any concerns regarding fit. Though there appeared to be a few residuals with a value slightly larger than 2 in absolute value (see left-hand plot in Figure 2), they were not influential points (see right-hand plot in Figure 2), since none of our observations had a Cook’s distance value &gt; 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Model Fit Plots\n\n\n\nAge and visibility were significant predictors of delayed gratification (see Table 2). For every year increase in age, the odds of taking the marshmallow decreased by a factor of 0.56 (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\, [0.47, 0.66])\\). When the marshmallow was hidden (as opposed to visible), the odds of taking the marshmallow decreased by a factor of 0.3 (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\, [0.17, 0.51])\\). Thus, we rejected the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Regression Table for Marshmallow Model\n\n\n \nMarshmallow Taken\n\n\nPredictors\nOdds Ratios\nCI\np\n\n\nIntercept\n81.93\n22.47 – 332.30\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nTime of Day - PM\n0.61\n0.34 – 1.08\n0.096\n\n\nAge (in years)\n0.56\n0.47 – 0.66\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nVisibility - Hidden\n0.30\n0.17 – 0.51\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n301\n\n\nR2 Tjur\n0.233\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct III: Discussion\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - What To Include\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question.\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\n\n\nThe probability of children delaying gratification did change as a function of age and marshmallow visibility (but not time of day). In summary, older age and conditions where the marshmallow was hidden appeared to be associated with greater odds of successfully delaying gratification."

To view solutions, click the drop down ‘Solution’ button.\nImportant  Before checking the solution you should attempt the question. You should also avoid copying and pasting code from the solutions. If you do check solutions right away and simply copy the answer, you will struggle to learn from the exercises.\nInstead, you should:\n\nTry to figure out the answer yourself or with your peers (and/or ask for help from a staff member if needed)\nType the code out yourself (and annotate your R code chunks so you know what your code is doing & why - future you will thank you for this).\n\n\n\n\nAsking Questions\n\nDuring labs, if you have a question, please ask one of the tutors for support.\nOutside of labs, we encourage you to use the various support options, details of which can be found on the Course Learn Page."

    "text": "Tips on Googling Statistics and R\nSearching online for help with statistics and R can be both a help and a hindrance. If you have an error message in R, copy the error message into Google. The results returned can sometimes just cause more confusion, but sometimes something might jump out at you and help you solve the problem. The same applies with searching the internet for help with statistics - search for “what is a p-value”, and you’ll find many many different articles and forum discussions etc. Some of them you will find too technical, but don’t be scared - the vast majority of people work in statistics will find these too technical too. Some of them you might feel are too simple/not helpful. As a general guide, keep clicking around the search responses, and you may end up finding that someone, somewhere, has provided an explanation at the right level. If you find something during your search which you don’t quite understand, feel free to link it in a post on the discussion forum!"
