Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nTo visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing and social interactions, density plots were used. To understand the strength of association between the two variables, the correlation coefficient was estimated. To investigate whether the number of weekly social interactions influences wellbeing (WEMWBS) scores, the following simple linear regression model was used:\n\\[\n\\text{Wellbeing} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Social Interactions}\n\\]\nFrom Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can see that both wellbeing \\((M = 36.3, SD = 5.39)\\) and social interactions \\((M = 12.06, SD = 4.02)\\) followed unimodal distributions. There was a weak, positive, linear association between WEMWBS scores and the weekly number of social interactions for the participants in the sample \\((r = .24)\\).\nFull regression results are displayed in Table 3. There was a significant association between wellbeing scores and social interactions \\((\\beta = 0.32, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001)\\). The estimated wellbeing score with no social interactions per week was 32.41. Each additional social interaction was associated with a 0.32 point increase in wellbeing scores."

The statistical models flaschards, specifically the multiple linear regression models flashcards may also be useful to refer to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe mwdata dataset contained information on 200 hypothetical participants who lived in Edinburgh & Lothians area. Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nDensity plots and boxplots will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing, social interactions, and outdoor time. To understand the strength of association among the variables, we will estimate the the correlation coefficients. To address the research question of whether there is an association between wellbeing and time spent outdoors after taking into account the association between wellbeing and social interactions, we are going to fit the following multiple linear regression model:\n\\[\n\\text{Wellbeing} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Social Interactions} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Outdoor Time} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\).\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_2 = 0\\): There is no association between wellbeing and time spent outdoors after taking into account the association between wellbeing and social interactions\n\\(H_1: \\beta_2 \\neq 0\\): There is an association between wellbeing and time spent outdoors after taking into account the association between wellbeing and social interactions"

Don’t forget you can look up the documentation by typing ?plot_model in the console.\nSince using plot_model(), We need to use ‘mdl_z’ here not ‘mdl_s’ - it won’t work with a model that’s used the scale() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nSemi-partial (part) correlation coefficient\nVisualisation\n\n\n\nFirst, lets recall the estimates from our standardized model (rounding to 2 decimal places):\n\nround(mdl_z$coefficients, 2)\n\n   (Intercept)   z_social_int z_outdoor_time \n          0.00           0.25           0.26 \n\n\nNext, lets calculate the semi-partial correlation coefficients:\n\n#semi-partial (part) correlation between wellbeing & social interactions\nwb_soc &lt;- spcor.test(mwdata$wellbeing, mwdata$social_int, mwdata$outdoor_time,  method=\"pearson\")\n#round correlation coefficient estimate to 2 decimal places\nround(wb_soc$estimate, 2)\n\n[1] 0.25\n\n#semi-partial (part) correlation between wellbeing & outdoor time\nwb_out &lt;- spcor.test(mwdata$wellbeing, mwdata$outdoor_time, mwdata$social_int, method=\"pearson\")\n#round correlation coefficient estimate to 2 decimal places\nround(wb_out$estimate, 2)\n\n[1] 0.26\n\n\nWe can see that the slope estimates from the standardized model are equivalent to the semi-partial (part) correlation coefficients. This makes theoretical sense given that:\nIn our example, we had a multiple regression model with two predictors, so in our case this means that the \\(\\beta^*\\) coefficients quantify the change in the dependent variable when one predictor (i.e., outdoor time) changes by one standard deviation while the other predictor remains constant (i.e., number of weekly social interactions); whilst the semi-partial correlation for a given predictor (i.e., outdoor time) represents the correlation between the dependent variable and that predictor (i.e., wellbeing and outdoor time) while controlling for the other predictor (i.e., number of weekly social interactions). Thus, the standardized estimate (i.e., \\(\\beta^*\\) coefficient) for one predictor in a multiple regression model with two predictors is equivalent to the semi-partial correlation coefficient for that predictor because, in this context, “holding all other predictors constant” refers to the one remaining predictor.\nNote\nIf this seems a bit confusing, try not to worry - it was more a demonstration of the relationship between \\(r\\) and \\(\\beta^*\\) for when you have 2 predictors (since you saw how this worked with 1 predictor in lecture, we thought it would be useful to extend to 2 predictors). Also, this can become pretty messy very quickly when you have a model with 3+ predictors as the associations among variables becomes more complex.\n\n\n\nplot_model(mdl_z, type = \"eff\",\n           terms = c(\"z_outdoor_time\"), \n           show.data = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nPlot the data and the fitted regression line from both the unstandardized and standardized models. To do so, for each model:\n\nExtract the estimated regression coefficients e.g., via betas &lt;- coef(mdl)\n\nExtract the first entry of betas (i.e., the intercept) via betas[1]\n\nExtract the second entry of betas (i.e., the slope) via betas[2]\n\nProvide the intercept and slope to the function\n\nNote down what you observe from the plots - what is the same / different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is very similar to Lab 1 Q7.\nExtracting values\nThe function coef() returns a vector (a sequence of numbers all of the same type). To get the first element of the sequence you append [1], and [2] for the second.\nPlotting\nIn your ggplot(), you will need to specify geom_abline(). This might help get you started:\n\n geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope) \n\n\nYou may also want to plot these side by side to more easily compare, so consider using | from patchwork.\nFor further ggplot() guidance, see the how to visualise data flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nFirst extract the values required for both non-standardized and standardized models:\n\n#non-standardized (from 'mdl')\nbetas &lt;- coef(mdl)\nintercept &lt;- betas[1]\nslope &lt;- betas[2]\n\n#standardized (from 'mdl_z')\nbetas_z &lt;- coef(mdl_z)\nintercept_z &lt;- betas_z[1]\nslope_z &lt;- betas_z[2]\n\nWe can plot the models as follows:\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope, color = 'blue') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = z_social_int, y = z_wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept_z, slope = slope_z, color = 'red') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week; z-scored)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores; z-scored\")\n\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities\n\nThe data points are distributed in the same pattern\n\nThe slope of the line follows the same gradient\n\nDifferences\n\nThe x- and y-axis scales are different for each plot. This is because:\n\nThe unstandardized is in the original units where we interpret the slope as the change in \\(y\\) units for a unit change in \\(x\\)\n\nThe standardized is in SD units where we interpret the slope as the SD change in \\(y\\) for 1 SD change in \\(x\\)"

All variables (wellbeing, social interactions, and outdoor time) were \\(z\\)-scored. As presented in Table 1, outdoor time was significantly associated with wellbeing scores \\((\\beta = 0.26, SE = 0.07, p &lt; .001)\\) after controlling for the number of weekly social interactions. Results suggested that, holding constant social interactions, for every standard deviation increase in outdoor time, wellbeing scores increased on average by 0.26 standard deviations. Therefore, we should reject the null hypothesis since \\(p &lt; .05\\)."

The simulated data are based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the following paper:\nRozgonjuk, D., Sindermann, C., Elhai, J. D., & Montag, C. (2021). Individual differences in Fear of Missing Out (FoMO): Age, gender, and the Big Five personality trait domains, facets, and items. Personality and Individual Differences, 171, 110546. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110546\nIn the current study, participants were invited to an online study investigating the associations among FoMO, socio-demographic factors, and personality. The final sample comprised 3370 people. Participants completed a FOMO scale and a personality inventory. The 10-item FOMO scale measured the extent of experiencing apprehension regarding missing out on interesting events of others on a 5-point scale (1 = “not at all true of me” to 5 = “extremely true of me”), producing a possible range of scores between 10 and 50. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a 45-item personality assessment questionnaire (note that only 43 items were used to match the study above) that uses a five-point response scale (1 = “very inapplicable” to 5 = “very applicable”). The BFI consists of five domains: Neuroticism (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Extraversion (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Openness to Experience (10 items; possible range of scores 10-50), Agreeableness (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), and Conscientiousness (9 items; possible range of scores 9-45). We extended the aforementioned study to include an extra socio-demographic variable - a measure of popularity on social media based on the number of followers. Unlike the original study, we do not have measures of gender, education level, or specific country of residence.\nData Dictionary\nThe data in FOMOdataset.csv contain eight attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=3370\\) hypothetical individuals across the UK, and include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nFOMO\nFoMO Score (as measured by the 10-item FoMO scale)\n\n\nAge\nAge (in years)\n\n\nN\nScore on personality items assessing Neuroticism from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nE\nScore on personality items assessing Extraversion from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nO\nScore on personality items assessing Openness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nA\nScore on personality items assessing Agreeableness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nC\nScore on personality items assessing Conscientiousness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nTotalFollowers\nTotal Number of Instagram Followers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOMO\n      Age\n      N\n      E\n      O\n      A\n      C\n      TotalFollowers\n    \n\n\n28\n38\n26\n30\n32\n27\n38\n98\n\n\n26\n30\n23\n27\n33\n32\n30\n192\n\n\n23\n33\n14\n30\n36\n27\n24\n177\n\n\n18\n44\n26\n21\n37\n28\n34\n119\n\n\n19\n43\n32\n21\n41\n35\n40\n278\n\n\n24\n43\n22\n25\n31\n30\n24\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the FOMO dataset into R, assigning it to an object named fomo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\n\n#Reading in fomo data and storing in object named 'fomo'\nfomo &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/FOMOdataset.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows\nhead(fomo)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n   FOMO   Age     N     E     O     A     C TotalFollowers\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    28    38    26    30    32    27    38             98\n2    26    30    23    27    33    32    30            192\n3    23    33    14    30    36    27    24            177\n4    18    44    26    21    37    28    34            119\n5    19    43    32    21    41    35    40            278\n6    24    43    22    25    31    30    24            184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

    "section": "Numeric Exploration",
    "text": "Numeric Exploration\nNumeric exploration of data involves examining and describing key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation via descriptives tables; and assessing the associations among variables through correlation coefficients. Exploring our data numerically helps us to identify patterns and associations in the data. When doing so, it is important to contextualise the descriptive statistics within the scope of the research question and associated scales.\nDescriptives\n\n Descriptives Tables\n\n\nThere are numerous packages available that allow us to pull out descriptive statistics from our dataset such as tidyverse and psych.\nWhen we pull out descriptive statistics, it is useful to present these in a well formatted table for your reader. There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the kable() function from the package kableExtra.\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via caption = \"insert caption here\", align values within columns e.g., center aligned via align = \"??\"), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via digits = ??).\nWe can also add in the function kable_styling(). This is really helpful for customsing your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!).\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n Descriptives Tables - Examples\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse way\nThe psych way\n\n\n\nWe can use the summarise() function to numerically summarise/describe our data. Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via mean(), standard deviation (via sd()), minimum value (via min()), maximum value (via max()), standard error (via se()), and skewness (via skew()).\n\nNumeric values only example:\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris |&gt;\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) |&gt;\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) |&gt;\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\nM_Length\nSD_Length\n\n\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe describe() function will produce a table of descriptive statistics. If you would like only a subset of this output (e.g., mean, sd), you can use select() after calling describe() e.g., describe() |&gt; select(mean, sd).\n\nNumeric values only example:\n\n\n\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# we want to get descriptive statistics of the iris dataset, specifically the sepal length column\n# we specifically want to select the mean and standard deviation from the descriptive statistics available (try this without including this argument to see what values you all get out)\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\ndescribe(iris$Sepal.Length) |&gt;\n    select(mean, sd) |&gt;\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) |&gt;\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\n\nmean\nsd\n\n\nX1\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation\n\n Correlation Coefficient\n\n\nThe correlation coefficient - \\(r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}\\) - is a standardised number which quantifies the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. In a population it is denoted by \\(\\rho\\), and in a sample it is denoted by \\(r\\).\nValues of \\(r\\) fall between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). How to interpret:\nSize\nMore extreme values (i.e., the The closer \\(r\\) is to \\(+/- 1\\)) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to \\(0\\) a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n\nWeak = \\(.1 &lt; |r| &lt; .3\\)\n\nModerate = \\(.3 &lt; |r| &lt; .5\\)\n\nStrong = \\(|r| &gt; .5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirection\nThe sign of \\(r\\) says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n\nPositive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation Matrix\n\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).\n\nIn R\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the cor() function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables must be numeric. One way to check this is by using the str() argument.\n\nLet’s check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe can see that the variable Species in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to subset, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside [], or using select(). In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\nIf you had NA values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these NAs using na.rm = TRUE inside the cor() function.\n\nIn R\n\n\nIndex dataframe ([])\nVariable selection (select())\n\n\n\n\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris |&gt; \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) |&gt;\n  cor() |&gt;\n  round(digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the population parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., \\(\\rho\\)).\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho = 0\\).

    "text": "Visual Exploration\nVisual exploration of our data allows us to visualize the distributions of our data, and to identify potential associations among variables.\n\n How to Visualise Data\n\n\nTo visualise (i.e., plot) our data, we can use ggplot() from the tidyverse package. Note the key components of the ggplot() code:\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the \\(x\\)-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data\n\n+ geom_... = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes()\n\n\nlabs() = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., bins =, alpha =, fill =, linewidth =. linetype =, size = etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using ? - e.g., ?fill.\nIf you’d like to read more about ggplot(), there is a handy cheatsheet.\n\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:\n\nUse to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels\n\nThe patchwork package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - | arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and / arranges the plots on top of one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Marginal Distributions - Examples\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nDensity\nBoxplot\n\n\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width.\nBasic:\n\nx-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\ny-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n\nWhat are bins?: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bins:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify bins = to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can specify binwidth = to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline Columns with Color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify color = to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill Columns with Color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify fill = to fill the columns with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Density” is a bit similar to the notion of “relative frequency” (or “proportion”), in that for a density curve, the values on the y-axis are scaled so that the total area under the curve is equal to 1. In creating a curve for which the total area underneath is equal to one, we can use the area under the curve in a range of values to indicate the proportion of values in that range.\nBasic:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilled:\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying fill = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Type & Width:\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying linetype = and linewidth = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots provide a useful way of visualising the interquartile range (IQR). You can see what each part of the boxplot represents in Figure Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a Boxplot\n\n\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_boxplot() to get a boxplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotate Boxplot:\nIf we had set aes(y = Sepal.Length) instead, then it would simply be rotated 90 degrees:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(y = Sepal.Length)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bivariate Associations - Examples\n\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within aes(), to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis.\n\n\nScatterplot\nScatterplot of Matrices (SPLOM)\n\n\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values.\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a cloud of scattered points.\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate\n\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill Points with Color:\nWithin geom_point(), we can specify color = to fill the points with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Size and Opacity:\nWe can change the size (using size =) and the opacity (using alpha =) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Line of Best Fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing pairs.panels() is likely the most useful way to visualise the associations among numeric variables. It returns a scatterplot of matrices (SPLOM) returning you (1) the marginal distribution of each variable via a histogram, (2) the correlation between variables, and (3) bivariate scatterplots.\n\niris |&gt;\n    select(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) |&gt;\n    pairs.panels(main = \"Iris SPLOM\")\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Iris SPLOM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multivariate Associations - Examples\n\n\nTo visualise multivariate associations, just like we do for bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis. We also need to take an extra step by specifying a third variable - z - that acts as a differentiating factor across our data. This ‘z’ can be mapped to an aesthetic attribute such as color, shape, or size, allowing us to explore more dynamic patterns and ssociations in our data.\nIf you really wanted to, you could create a plot showing the associations among three variables at once. These are likely more useful when you have an interaction model. However, we wouldn’t really recommend doing this - they can be very difficult to interpret correctly, and given their interactive nature, definitely NOT something that you’d want to include in a stats report. But, for demonstration purposes only, we could create one using the plotly package.\n3D Scatterplot\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nplot_ly(data = iris, \n        x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Sepal.Length, z = ~Petal.Width, \n        type = 'scatter3d', \n        mode = 'markers+lines',\n        scene = list(\n            xaxis = list(title = \"Petal Length\"),\n            yaxis = list(title = \"Sepal Length\"),\n            zaxis = list(title = \"Petal Width\")\n            )\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap of Correlations\n\nplot_ly(z = ~cor(iris[, c(1, 3:4)]), type = \"heatmap\")"

    "text": "Deterministic Models\n\n Description & Specification\n\n\nWe come across functions a lot in daily life, and probably don’t think much about it. In a slightly more mathematical setting, we can write down in words and in symbols the function describing the association between the side of a square and its perimeter (e.g., to capture how the perimeter varies as a function of its side). In this case, the perimeter is the dependent variable, and the side is the independent variable.\nThis is what we would refer to as a deterministic model, as it is a model of an exact relationship - there can be no deviation.\nModel Specification\n\n\nIn words\nIn symbols\n\n\n\nThe perimeter of a square is four times the length of its side.\n\n\nThe relationship between side and perimeter of squares is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\cdot \\text{Side}\n\\]\nIf you denote \\(y\\) as the dependent variable Perimeter, and \\(x\\) as the independent variable Side we can rewrite as:\n\\[\ny = 4 \\cdot x\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Visualisation\n\n\nLet’s create a dataset called squares, containing the perimeter of four squares having sides of length \\(0, 2, 5, 9\\) metres, and then plot the squares data as points on a scatterplot.\nFirst, let’s make our squares data. Here we will use two important functions - tibble() and c(). The tibble() function allows us to construct a data frame. To store a sequence of numbers into R, we can combine the values using c(). A sequence of elements all of the same type is called a vector.\n\n#create data frame named squares\nsquares &lt;- tibble(\n  side = c(0, 2, 5, 9), \n  perimeter = 4 * side\n)\n\n#check that our values are contained within squares\nsquares\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n   side perimeter\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0         0\n2     2         8\n3     5        20\n4     9        36\n\n\nNow we know how ggplot() works, we can start to build our plot. First we specify our data (we want to use the squares data frame), and then our aesthetics. Since the perimeter varies as a function of side, we want side on the \\(x\\)-axis, and perimeter on the \\(y\\)-axis. We want to create a scatterplot, so we need to specify our geom_... argument as geom_point(). Lastly, we will provide clearer axis labels, and include the units of measurement.\n\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +  \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')  \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Perimeter = 4*Side\n\n\n\nWe could also visualise the functional relationship by connecting the individual points with a line. To do so, we need to add a new argument - geom_line(). If you would like to change the colour of the line from the default, you can specify geom_line(colour = \"insert colour name\").\n\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(colour = \"darkred\") + \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')  \n\n\n\nFigure 4: Perimeter = 4*Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Predicted Values\n\n\nSometimes we can directly read a predicted value from the graph of the functional relationship.\nConsider the plot created above. For example, first we need to check where \\(x\\) = 2.5. Then, we draw a vertical dashed line until it meets the blue line. The \\(y\\) value corresponding to \\(x\\) = 2.5 can be read off the \\(y\\)-axis. In our case, we would say a side of 2.5m corresponds to a perimeter of 10m.\n\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(colour = \"blue\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5, colour = \"darkred\", lty = \"dashed\", lwd = 1) + \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4 * Side')  \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Perimeter = 4*Side\n\n\n\nHowever, in this case it is not that easy to read it from Figure 5 (especially without the superimposed dashed red line)… This leads us to the algebraic approach:\nWe can substitute the \\(x\\) value in the formula and calculate the corresponding \\(y\\) value where we would conclude that the predicted perimeter of squared paintings having a 2.5m side is 10m:\n\\[\ny = 4 \\cdot x  \\\\    \n\\]\n\\[\ny = 4 \\cdot 2.5 \\\\  \n\\]\n\\[\ny = 10  \\\\\n\\]"

    "text": "Numeric Outcomes & Numeric Predictors\nSimple Linear Regression Models\n\n Description & Model Specification\n\n\nThe association between two variables (e.g., recall accuracy and age) will show deviations from the ‘average pattern’. Hence, we need to create a model that allows for deviations from the linear relationship - we need a statistical model.\nA statistical model includes both a deterministic function and a random error term. We typically refer to the outcome (‘dependent’) variable with the letter \\(y\\) and to our predictor (‘explanatory’/‘independent’) variables with the letter \\(x\\). A simple (i.e., one x variable only) linear regression model thus takes the following form (where the terms \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are numbers specifying where the line going through the data meets the y-axis (i.e., the intercept - where \\(x\\) = 0; \\(\\beta_0\\)) and its slope (direction and gradient of line; \\(\\beta_1\\)):\nModel Specification\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\nModel Specification: Annotated\n\\[\ny_i = \\underbrace{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i}_{\\text{function of }x} + \\underbrace{\\epsilon_i}_{\\text{random error}}  \n\\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\nModel Specification: Explained\nLet’s break down what \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\\) actually means by considering the statement in smaller parts:\n\n\n\\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i\\)\n\n\n\\(y_i\\) is our measured outcome variable (our DV)\n\n\n\\(x_i\\) is our measured predictor variable (our IV)\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the model intercept\n\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) is the model slope\n\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is the residual error\n\n\n\\(\\sim\\) means ‘distributed according to’\n\n\n\\(N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\\) means ‘normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of \\(\\sigma\\)’\n\nTogether, we can say that the errors around the line have a mean of zero and constant spread as x varies\n\n\n\n\nIn R\nThere are basically two pieces of information that we need to pass to the lm() function:\n\nThe formula: The regression formula should be specified in the form y ~ x where \\(y\\) is the dependent variable (DV) and \\(x\\) the independent variable (IV).\nThe data: Specify which dataframe contains the variables specified in the formula.\n\nIn R, the syntax of the lm() function can be specified as follows (where DV = dependent variable, IV = independent variable, and data_name = the name of your dataset):\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV, data = data_name) \n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV)\n\n\n\n\nyou can also specify as:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ 1 + IV, data = data_name) \n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ 1 + data_name$IV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is there a 1 in the two bottom options?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we specify the linear model in R, we include after the tilde sign (\\(\\sim\\)), the variables that appear to the right of the \\(\\hat \\beta\\)s. The intercept, or \\(\\beta_0\\), is a constant. That is, we could write it as multiplied by 1.\nIncluding the 1 explicitly is not necessary because it is included by default (you can check this by comparing the outputs of A & B above with and without the 1 included - the estimates are the same!). After a while, you will find you just want to drop the 1 when calling lm() because you know that it’s going to be there, but in these early weeks we tried to keep it explicit to make it clear that you want the intercept to be estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nResearch Question\nIs there an association between recall accuracy and age?\n\n\n Overview\n\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether there was an association between recall accuracy and age. You have been provided with data from twenty participants who studied passages of text (c500 words long), and were tested a week later.

You simply add (using the + sign) more independent variables. For example, if we wanted to build a multiple linear regression that included three independent variables, we could fit one of the following via the lm() function:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV1 + data_name$IV2 + data_name$IV3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interpretation of Coefficients\n\n\nYou’ll hear a lot of different ways that people explain multiple regression coefficients.\nFor the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon\\), the estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) will often be reported as:\n“the increase in \\(y\\) for a one unit increase in \\(x_1\\) when…”\n\n“holding the effect of \\(x_2\\) constant.”\n“controlling for differences in \\(x_2\\).”\n“partialling out the effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n“holding \\(x_2\\) equal.”\n“accounting for effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n\nFor models with 3+ predictors, just like building the model in R, the logic of the above simply extends.\nFor example “the increase in [outcome] for a one unit increase in [predictor] when…”\n\n“holding [other predictors] constant.”\n\n“accounting for [other predictors].”\n\n“controlling for differences in [other predictors].”\n\n“partialling out the effects of [other predictors].”\n\n“holding [other predictors] equal.”\n\n“accounting for effects of [other predictors].”\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nResearch Question\nIs recall accuracy associated with recall confidence and age?\n\n\n Overview\n\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether recall accuracy was associated with recall confidence and age.

As well as knowing how to extract from R, it is necessary to understand how to compute some of these statistics by hand too.\n\n Model Call\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, model formula highlighted\n\n\n\nThe call section at the very top of the summary() output shows us the formula that was specified in R to fit the regression model.\nIn the above, we can see that recall accuracy is our DV, recall confidence and age were our two IVs, and our dataset was named recalldata.\n\n\n\n\n\n Residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, residuals highlighted\n\n\n\nResiduals are the difference between the observed values and model predicted values of the DV.\nIdeally, for the model to be unbiased, we want our median value (the middle value of the residuals when ordered) to be around 0, as this would show that the errors are random fluctuations around the true line. When this is the case, we know that our model is doing a good job predicting values at the high and low ends of our dataset, and that our residuals were somewhat symmetrical.\n\n\n\n\n\n Model Coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, model coefficients highlighted\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates\nStd.

Since \\(|t|\\) is larger than \\(t^*\\) (-2.21 &gt; 2.11), we can reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(t\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could use the following:\n\ncoef(summary(mdl))[, \"t value\"]\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,3]\n\nFor example:\n\ncoef(summary(recall_multi))[, \"t value\"]\n\n      (Intercept) recall_confidence               age \n         2.815890          4.684654         -2.211515 \n\n\n\nsummary(recall_multi)$coefficients[,3]\n\n      (Intercept) recall_confidence               age \n         2.815890          4.684654         -2.211515 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom our \\(t\\)-value, we can compute our \\(p\\)-value. The \\(p\\)-value help us to understand whether our coefficient(s) are statistically significant (i.e., that the coefficient is statistically different from 0). The \\(p\\)-value of each estimate indicates the probability of observing a \\(t\\)-value at least as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data when assuming the null hypothesis to be true.\nIn Psychology, a \\(p\\)-value &lt; .05 is usually used to make statements regarding statistical significance (it is important that you always state your \\(\\alpha\\) level to help your reader understand any statements regarding statistical significance).\nThe number of asterisks marks corresponds with the significance of the coefficient (see the ‘Signif. codes’ legend just under the coefficients section).\n\nIn R\nIf you wanted to obtain just the \\(p\\)-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named mdl):\n\nsummary(mdl)$coefficients[,4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Confidence Intervals\n\n\nUsing the estimate and standard error of a given \\(\\beta\\) coefficient, we can create confidence intervals to estimate a plausible range of values for the true population parameter.

Our test is framed in terms of the following hypotheses:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{the model is ineffective, }b_1,...., b_k = 0 \\\\    \n\\]\n\\[\nH_1 : \\text{the model is effective, }b_1,...., b_k  \\neq 0 \\\\  \n\\]\nThe relevant test-statistic is the \\(F\\)-statistic, which uses “Mean Squares” (these are Sums of Squares divided by the relevant degrees of freedom). We then compare that against (you guessed it) an \\(F\\)-distribution! \\(F\\)-distributions vary according to two parameters, which are both degrees of freedom.\nFormula:\n\\[\n\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{\\text{MS}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{MS}_\\text{Residual}} = \\frac{\\text{SS}_\\text{Model}/\\text{df}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{SS}_\\text{Residual}/\\text{df}_\\text{Residual}} \\\\\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& df_{model} = k \\\\\n& df_{residual} = n-k-1 \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k  = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nDescription:\nTo test the significance of an overall model, we can conduct an \\(F\\)-test. The \\(F\\)-test compares your model to a model containing zero predictor variables (i.e., the intercept only model), and tests whether your added predictor variables significantly improved the model.\nIt is called the \\(F\\)-ratio because it is the ratio of the how much of the variation is explained by the model (per parameter) versus how much of the variation is unexplained (per remaining degrees of freedom).\nThe \\(F\\)-test involves testing the statistical significance of the \\(F\\)-ratio.\nQ: What does the \\(F\\)-ratio test?A: The null hypothesis that all regression slopes in a model are zero (i.e., explain no variance in your outcome/DV). The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the slopes is not zero.\nThe \\(F\\)-ratio you see at the bottom of summary(model) is actually a comparison between two models: your model (with some explanatory variables in predicting \\(y\\)) and the null model.\nIn regression, the null model can be thought of as the model in which all explanatory variables have zero regression coefficients. It is also referred to as the intercept-only model, because if all predictor variable coefficients are zero, then we are only estimating \\(y\\) via an intercept (which will be the mean - \\(\\bar y\\)).\nInterpretation:\nAlongside viewing the \\(F\\)-ratio, you can see the results from testing the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients are \\(0\\) (the alternative hypothesis is that at least one coefficient is \\(\\neq 0\\). Under the null hypothesis that all coefficients = 0, the ratio of explained:unexplained variance should be approximately 1)\nIf your model predictors do explain some variance, the \\(F\\)-ratio will be significant, and you would reject the null, as this would suggest that your predictor variables included in your model improved the model fit (in comparison to the intercept only model).\nPoints to note:\n\nThe larger your \\(F\\)-ratio, the better your model\nThe \\(F\\)-ratio will be close to 1 when the null is true (i.e., that all slopes are zero)\n\nHow to calculate \\(F\\)-ratio\n\n\nBy Hand\nUsing R\n\n\n\nSteps:\n\nCalculate model sum of squares\nCalculate residual sum of squares\nCalculate total sum of squares\nCalculate \\(df_{model}\\)\n\nCalculate \\(df_{residual}\\)\n\n\nStep 1, 2, & 3\nFollow steps above in the Sums of Squares flashcard:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{SS}_\\text{Total} = 10  \\\\\n& \\text{SS}_\\text{Residual} = 5.1 \\\\  \n& \\text{SS}_\\text{Model} = 4.9 \\\\  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nStep 4: Calculate \\(df_{model}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&df_{model} = k  \\\\  \n&df_{model} = 1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nStep 5: Calculate \\(df_{residual}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&df_{residual} = n-k-1   \\\\  \n&df_{residual} = 5-1-1  \\\\  \n&df_{residual} = 3  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{\\text{MS}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{MS}_\\text{Residual}} = \\frac{\\text{SS}_\\text{Model}/\\text{df}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{SS}_\\text{Residual}/\\text{df}_\\text{Residual}} \\\\  \n\\\\  \n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{4.9/1}{5.1/3} \\\\  \n\\\\  \n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{4.9}{1.7} \\\\  \n\\\\  \n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = 2.88  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn R\nWe can see the \\(F\\)-statistic and associated \\(p\\)-value at the bottom of the output of summary(&lt;modelname&gt;):\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, F statistic highlighted\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can extract this information as it is stored in the summary() of the model:\n\n#F-Statistic\nsummary(recall_multi)$fstatistic\n\n   value    numdf    dendf \n12.92426  2.00000 17.00000 \n\n#P-Value\npf(summary(recall_multi)$fstatistic[1], \n   summary(recall_multi)$fstatistic[2], \n   summary(recall_multi)$fstatistic[3], \n   lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n       value \n0.0003866881 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nThe linear model with recall confidence and age explained a significant amount of variance in recall accuracy beyond what we would expect by chance \\(F(2, 17) = 12.92, p &lt; .001\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R-squared and Adjusted R-squared\n\n\nOverview:\n\\(R^2\\) represents the proportion of variance in \\(Y\\) that is explained by the model predictor variables.\nFormula:\nThe \\(R^2\\) coefficient is defined as the proportion of the total variability in the outcome variable which is explained by our model:\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}\n\\]\nThe Adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient is defined as:\n\\[\n\\hat R^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nWhen to report Multiple \\(R^2\\) vs. Adjusted \\(R^2\\):\nThe Multiple \\(R^2\\) value should be reported for a simple linear regression model (i.e., one predictor).\nUnlike \\(R^2\\), Adjusted-\\(R^2\\) does not necessarily increase with the addition of more explanatory variables, by the inclusion of a penalty according to the number of explanatory variables in the model. Since Adjusted-\\(R^2\\) is adjusted for the number of predictors in the model, this should be used when there are 2 or more predictors in the model.

    "text": "Linear Models\nOne useful thing we might want to do is compare our models with and without some predictor(s).There are numerous ways we can do this, but the method chosen depends on the models and underlying data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Nested vs Non-Nested Models\n\n\nNested Models\nConsider that you have two regression models where Model 1 contains a subset of the predictors contained in the other Model 2 and is fitted to the same data. More simply, Model 2 contains all of the predictors included in Model 1, plus additional predictor(s). This means that Model 1 is nested within Model 2, or that Model 1 is a submodel of Model 2. These two terms, at least in this setting, are interchangeable - it might be easier to think of Model 1 as your null and Model 2 as your alternative.\nNon-Nested Models\nConsider that you have two regression models where Model 1 contains different variables to those contained in Model 2, where both models are fitted to the same data. More simply, Model 1 and Model 2 contain unique variables that are not shared. This means that Model 1 and Model 2 are not nested.\n\n\n\n\n\n Incremental F-test\n\n\nIf (and only if) two models are nested, can we compare them using an incremental F-test.\nThis is a formal test of whether the additional predictors provide a better fitting model.\nFormally this is the test of:\n\n\\(H_0:\\) coefficients for the added/omitted variables are all zero.\n\\(H_1:\\) at least one of the added/omitted variables has a coefficient that is not zero.\n\nThe \\(F\\)-ratio for comparing the residual sums of squares between two models can be calculated as:\n\\[\nF_{(df_R-df_F),~df_F} = \\frac{(SSR_R-SSR_F)/(df_R-df_F)}{SSR_F / df_F} \\\\\n\\quad \\\\\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n\\\\\n& SSR_R = \\text{residual sums of squares for the restricted model} \\\\\n& SSR_F = \\text{residual sums of squares for the full model} \\\\\n& df_R = \\text{residual degrees of freedom from the restricted model} \\\\\n& df_F = \\text{residual degrees of freedom from the full model} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nIn R\nWe can conduct an incremental \\(F\\)-test to compare two models by fitting both models using lm(), and passing them to the anova() function:\n\nmodel1 &lt;- lm( ... )\nmodel2 &lt;- lm( ... )\nanova(model1, model2)\n\nIf we wanted to, for example, compare a model with just one predictor, \\(x1\\), to a model with 2 predictors: \\(x1\\), and \\(x2\\), we can assess the extent to which the variable \\(x2\\) improves model fit:\n\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(y ~ x1, data = data_name)\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data_name)\nanova(model1, model2)\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\nModel Comparisons using Incremental F-test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nRecall confidence explained a significant amount of variance in recall accuracy beyond age \\((F(1, 17) = 21.95, p &lt; .001)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n AIC & BIC\n\n\nAIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) combine information about the sample size, the number of model parameters, and the residual sums of squares (\\(SS_{residual}\\)). Models do not need to be nested to be compared via AIC and BIC, but they need to have been fit to the same dataset.\nAIC can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& AIC = n\\,\\text{ln}\\left( \\frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \\right) + 2k \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\nBIC can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& BIC = n\\,\\text{ln}\\left( \\frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \\right) + k\\,\\text{ln}(n) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\nWhere for both AIC and BIC:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& SS_{residual} = \\text{sum of squares residuals} \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n& \\text{ln} = \\text{natural log function}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor both of these fit indices, lower values are better, and both include a penalty for the number of predictors in the model (although BIC’s penalty is harsher).\nSo how do we determine whether there is a statistical difference between two models? To evaluate our model comparisons, we need to look at the difference (\\(\\Delta\\)) between the two values:\n\nAIC: There are no specific thresholds to suggest how big a difference in two models is needed to conclude that one is substantively better than the other\nBIC: Using the following \\(\\Delta BIC\\) cutoffs (Raftery, 1995):\n\n\n\nValue\nInterpretation of Difference between Models\n\n\n\n\\(\\Delta &lt; 2\\)\nNo evidence\n\n\n\\(2 &gt; \\Delta &lt; 6\\)\nPositive evidence\n\n\n\\(6 &gt; \\Delta &lt; 10\\)\nStrong evidence\n\n\n\\(\\Delta &gt; 10\\)\nVery strong evidence\n\n\n\n\nIn R\nWe can calculate AIC and BIC by using the AIC() and BIC() functions respectively:\n\n#AIC\nAIC(modelname)\n\n#BIC\nBIC(modelname)\n\nFor example, with AIC:\n\n\n\n\nModel Comparisons using AIC\n\n\n\nand BIC:\n\n\n\n\nModel Comparisons using BIC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nBased on both AIC and BIC, the model predicting recall accuracy that included both recall confidence and age was better fitting \\((\\text{AIC} = 152.28; \\text{BIC} = 156.27)\\) than the model with age alone \\((\\text{AIC} = 166.86; \\text{BIC} = 169.85)\\)."

There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the kable() function from the package kableExtra.\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via caption = \"insert caption here\", align values within columns e.g., center aligned via align = \"??\"), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via digits = ??).\nWe can also add in the function kable_styling(). This is really helpful for customsing your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!).\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n Descriptives Tables - Examples\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse way\nThe psych way\n\n\n\nWe can use the summarise() function to numerically summarise/describe our data. Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via mean(), standard deviation (via sd()), minimum value (via min()), maximum value (via max()), standard error (via se()), and skewness (via skew()).\n\n\nNumeric values only example:\nCategorical and numeric values example:\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris |&gt;\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) |&gt;\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) |&gt;\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\nM_Length\nSD_Length\n\n\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# grouping by Species.

In a population it is denoted by \\(\\rho\\), and in a sample it is denoted by \\(r\\).\nValues of \\(r\\) fall between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). How to interpret:\nSize\nMore extreme values (i.e., the The closer \\(r\\) is to \\(+/- 1\\)) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to \\(0\\) a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n\nWeak = \\(.1 &lt; |r| &lt; .3\\)\n\nModerate = \\(.3 &lt; |r| &lt; .5\\)\n\nStrong = \\(|r| &gt; .5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirection\nThe sign of \\(r\\) says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n\nPositive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation Matrix\n\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).\n\nIn R\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the cor() function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables must be numeric. One way to check this is by using the str() argument.\n\nLet’s check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe can see that the variable Species in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to subset, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside [], or using select(). In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\nIf you had NA values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these NAs using na.rm = TRUE inside the cor() function.\n\nIn R\n\n\nIndex dataframe ([])\nVariable selection (select())\n\n\n\n\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris |&gt; \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) |&gt;\n  cor() |&gt;\n  round(digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the population parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., \\(\\rho\\)).\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho = 0\\).

Note the key components of the ggplot() code:\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the \\(x\\)-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data\n\n+ geom_... = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes()\n\n\nlabs() = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., bins =, alpha =, fill =, linewidth =. linetype =, size = etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using ? - e.g., ?fill.\nIf you’d like to read more about ggplot(), there is a handy cheatsheet.\n\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:\n\nUse to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels\n\nThe patchwork package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - | arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and / arranges the plots on top of one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Marginal Distributions - Examples\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nDensity\nBoxplot\n\n\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width.\nBasic:\n\nx-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\ny-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n\nWhat are bins?: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bins:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify bins = to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can specify binwidth = to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline Columns with Color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify color = to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill Columns with Color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify fill = to fill the columns with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Density” is a bit similar to the notion of “relative frequency” (or “proportion”), in that for a density curve, the values on the y-axis are scaled so that the total area under the curve is equal to 1. In creating a curve for which the total area underneath is equal to one, we can use the area under the curve in a range of values to indicate the proportion of values in that range.\nBasic:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilled:\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying fill = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Type & Width:\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying linetype = and linewidth = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots provide a useful way of visualising the interquartile range (IQR). You can see what each part of the boxplot represents in Figure Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a Boxplot\n\n\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_boxplot() to get a boxplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotate Boxplot:\nIf we had set aes(y = Sepal.Length) instead, then it would simply be rotated 90 degrees:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(y = Sepal.Length)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bivariate Associations - Examples\n\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within aes(), to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis.\n\n\nScatterplot\nScatterplot of Matrices (SPLOM)\nBoxplot\nFacets\n\n\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values.\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a cloud of scattered points.\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate\n\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill Points with Color:\nWithin geom_point(), we can specify color = to fill the points with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Size and Opacity:\nWe can change the size (using size =) and the opacity (using alpha =) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Line of Best Fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing pairs.panels() is likely the most useful way to visualise the associations among numeric variables. It returns a scatterplot of matrices (SPLOM) returning you (1) the marginal distribution of each variable via a histogram, (2) the correlation between variables, and (3) bivariate scatterplots.\n\niris |&gt;\n    select(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) |&gt;\n    pairs.panels(main = \"Iris SPLOM\")\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Iris SPLOM\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a boxplot to visualise the association between one numeric variable and one categorical variable - these will be our y- and x-axis values respectively. This can be helpful to visually compare the distribution of multiple groups.\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_boxplot() to get a boxplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange boxplot fill colours by group:\nWithin aes(), we can specify fill = to fill the boxes with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange boxplot line colours by group:\nWithin aes(), we can specify color = to colour the lines with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding jitter:\nWe can add jittered points to a boxplot to better see the underlying distribution of the data (by adding a little random variation to each data point) via geom_jitter():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    geom_jitter() + \n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange legend position:\nWe can add the argument + theme(legend.position = ) to move (or even remove) the legend by specifying, for example, \"right\", \"left\", \"top\", \"bottom\", or \"none\" to remove.\n\n# legend at bottom of plot\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\") + \n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have two numeric variables, as well as categorical variables, we can use facet_wrap() / facet_grid() to help divide/arrange our plots. If we had two categorical variables, by simply stringing them together to further group our plots by specifying facet_wrap( ~ cat_variable1 + cat_variable2)\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot, and either + facet_wrap() or + facet_grid() to separate by your categorical variable:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(~Species) + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE.

This ‘z’ can be mapped to an aesthetic attribute such as color, shape, or size, allowing us to explore more dynamic patterns and ssociations in our data.\nIf you really wanted to, you could create a plot showing the associations among three variables at once. These are likely more useful when you have an interaction model. However, we wouldn’t really recommend doing this - they can be very difficult to interpret correctly, and given their interactive nature, definitely NOT something that you’d want to include in a stats report. But, for demonstration purposes only, we could create one using the plotly package.\n3D Scatterplot\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nplot_ly(data = iris, \n        x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Sepal.Length, z = ~Petal.Width, \n        type = 'scatter3d', \n        mode = 'markers+lines',\n        scene = list(\n            xaxis = list(title = \"Petal Length\"),\n            yaxis = list(title = \"Sepal Length\"),\n            zaxis = list(title = \"Petal Width\")\n            )\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap of Correlations\n\nplot_ly(z = ~cor(iris[, c(1, 3:4)]), type = \"heatmap\")"

    "text": "Deterministic Models\n\n Description & Specification\n\n\nWe come across functions a lot in daily life, and probably don’t think much about it. In a slightly more mathematical setting, we can write down in words and in symbols the function describing the association between the side of a square and its perimeter (e.g., to capture how the perimeter varies as a function of its side). In this case, the perimeter is the dependent variable, and the side is the independent variable.\nThis is what we would refer to as a deterministic model, as it is a model of an exact relationship - there can be no deviation.\nModel Specification\n\n\nIn words\nIn symbols\n\n\n\nThe perimeter of a square is four times the length of its side.\n\n\nThe relationship between side and perimeter of squares is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\cdot \\text{Side}\n\\]\nIf you denote \\(y\\) as the dependent variable Perimeter, and \\(x\\) as the independent variable Side we can rewrite as:\n\\[\ny = 4 \\cdot x\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Visualisation\n\n\nLet’s create a dataset called squares, containing the perimeter of four squares having sides of length \\(0, 2, 5, 9\\) metres, and then plot the squares data as points on a scatterplot.\nFirst, let’s make our squares data. Here we will use two important functions - tibble() and c(). The tibble() function allows us to construct a data frame. To store a sequence of numbers into R, we can combine the values using c(). A sequence of elements all of the same type is called a vector.\n\n#create data frame named squares\nsquares &lt;- tibble(\n  side = c(0, 2, 5, 9), \n  perimeter = 4 * side\n)\n\n#check that our values are contained within squares\nsquares\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n   side perimeter\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0         0\n2     2         8\n3     5        20\n4     9        36\n\n\nNow we know how ggplot() works, we can start to build our plot. First we specify our data (we want to use the squares data frame), and then our aesthetics. Since the perimeter varies as a function of side, we want side on the \\(x\\)-axis, and perimeter on the \\(y\\)-axis. We want to create a scatterplot, so we need to specify our geom_... argument as geom_point(). Lastly, we will provide clearer axis labels, and include the units of measurement.\n\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +  \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')  \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Perimeter = 4*Side\n\n\n\nWe could also visualise the functional relationship by connecting the individual points with a line. To do so, we need to add a new argument - geom_line(). If you would like to change the colour of the line from the default, you can specify geom_line(colour = \"insert colour name\").\n\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(colour = \"darkred\") + \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')  \n\n\n\nFigure 4: Perimeter = 4*Side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Predicted Values\n\n\nSometimes we can directly read a predicted value from the graph of the functional relationship.\nConsider the plot created above. For example, first we need to check where \\(x\\) = 2.5. Then, we draw a vertical dashed line until it meets the blue line. The \\(y\\) value corresponding to \\(x\\) = 2.5 can be read off the \\(y\\)-axis. In our case, we would say a side of 2.5m corresponds to a perimeter of 10m.\n\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(colour = \"blue\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5, colour = \"darkred\", lty = \"dashed\", lwd = 1) + \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4 * Side')  \n\n\n\nFigure 5: Perimeter = 4*Side\n\n\n\nHowever, in this case it is not that easy to read it from Figure 5 (especially without the superimposed dashed red line)… This leads us to the algebraic approach:\nWe can substitute the \\(x\\) value in the formula and calculate the corresponding \\(y\\) value where we would conclude that the predicted perimeter of squared paintings having a 2.5m side is 10m:\n\\[\ny = 4 \\cdot x  \\\\    \n\\]\n\\[\ny = 4 \\cdot 2.5 \\\\  \n\\]\n\\[\ny = 10  \\\\\n\\]"

    "text": "Numeric Outcomes & Numeric Predictors\nSimple Linear Regression Models\n\n Description & Model Specification\n\n\nThe association between two variables (e.g., recall accuracy and age) will show deviations from the ‘average pattern’. Hence, we need to create a model that allows for deviations from the linear relationship - we need a statistical model.\nA statistical model includes both a deterministic function and a random error term. We typically refer to the outcome (‘dependent’) variable with the letter \\(y\\) and to our predictor (‘explanatory’/‘independent’) variables with the letter \\(x\\). A simple (i.e., one x variable only) linear regression model thus takes the following form (where the terms \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are numbers specifying where the line going through the data meets the y-axis (i.e., the intercept - where \\(x\\) = 0; \\(\\beta_0\\)) and its slope (direction and gradient of line; \\(\\beta_1\\)):\nModel Specification\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\nModel Specification: Annotated\n\\[\ny_i = \\underbrace{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i}_{\\text{function of }x} + \\underbrace{\\epsilon_i}_{\\text{random error}}  \n\\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\nModel Specification: Explained\nLet’s break down what \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\\) actually means by considering the statement in smaller parts:\n\n\n\\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i\\)\n\n\n\\(y_i\\) is our measured outcome variable (our DV)\n\n\n\\(x_i\\) is our measured predictor variable (our IV)\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the model intercept\n\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) is the model slope\n\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is the residual error\n\n\n\\(\\sim\\) means ‘distributed according to’\n\n\n\\(N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\\) means ‘normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of \\(\\sigma\\)’\n\nTogether, we can say that the errors around the line have a mean of zero and constant spread as x varies\n\n\n\n\nIn R\nThere are basically two pieces of information that we need to pass to the lm() function:\n\nThe formula: The regression formula should be specified in the form y ~ x where \\(y\\) is the dependent variable (DV) and \\(x\\) the independent variable (IV).\nThe data: Specify which dataframe contains the variables specified in the formula.\n\nIn R, the syntax of the lm() function can be specified as follows (where DV = dependent variable, IV = independent variable, and data_name = the name of your dataset):\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV, data = data_name) \n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV)\n\n\n\n\nyou can also specify as:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ 1 + IV, data = data_name) \n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ 1 + data_name$IV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is there a 1 in the two bottom options?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we specify the linear model in R, we include after the tilde sign (\\(\\sim\\)), the variables that appear to the right of the \\(\\hat \\beta\\)s. The intercept, or \\(\\beta_0\\), is a constant. That is, we could write it as multiplied by 1.\nIncluding the 1 explicitly is not necessary because it is included by default (you can check this by comparing the outputs of A & B above with and without the 1 included - the estimates are the same!). After a while, you will find you just want to drop the 1 when calling lm() because you know that it’s going to be there, but in these early weeks we tried to keep it explicit to make it clear that you want the intercept to be estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nResearch Question\nIs there an association between recall accuracy and age?\n\n\n Overview\n\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether there was an association between recall accuracy and age. You have been provided with data from twenty participants who studied passages of text (c500 words long), and were tested a week later. The testing phase presented participants with 100 statements about the text. They had to answer whether each statement was true or false, as well as rate their confidence in each answer (on a sliding scale from 0 to 100). The dataset contains, for each participant, the percentage of items correctly answered, their age (in years), and their average confidence rating.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/recalldata.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n Visualise Data\n\n\nThere are lots of different ways in which we can visualise our data (as per the Visual Exploration flashcards).\nFor the marginal distributions we will use density and boxplots, and for the bivariate associations a scatterplot.\n\n#save plots to individual objects in order to arrange \n\nplt1 &lt;- ggplot(data = recalldata, aes(x = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_density() +\n    xlim(0, 100) + #specify x-axis to range from 0-100\n    geom_boxplot(width = 1/100) + \n    labs(x = \"Recall Accuracy (%)\", title = \"Distribtion of \\nRecall Accuracy\")\n\nplt2 &lt;- ggplot(data = recalldata, aes(x = age)) + \n    geom_density() +\n    xlim(0, 100) + #specify x-axis to range from 0-100\n    geom_boxplot(width = 1/100) + \n    labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", title = \"Distribtion of \\nAge\")\n\nplt3 &lt;- ggplot(data = recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", y = \"Recall Accuracy (%)\", title = \"Association between Recall Accuracy and Age\")\n\n\n#load patchwork package to arrange plots\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#arrange plots where there are two plots in to panel (plt1 + plt2), one on bottom (plt3)\n(plt1 + plt2) / plt3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal distribution of recall accuracy was unimodal with a negative skew with a mean of approximately 69.25. There was high variation in recall accuracy (SD = 14.53)\n\nThe marginal distribution of age was unimodal with a mean of approximately 48.8, where age ranged from 22 to 86\n\nThere appeared to be a weak negative association between recall accuracy and age, where older age was associated with lower recall accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Model & Hypothesis Specification\n\n\n\n\nModel Specification\nHypothesis Specification\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\text{Recall Accuracy}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Age}_i + \\epsilon_i    \n\\]\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\)\nThere is no association between recall accuracy and age.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\)\nThere is an association between recall accuracy and age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Model Building\n\n\nTo fit the model in R we use the lm() function. The simple linear model is assigned/stored in an object called recall_simp:\n\nrecall_simp &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n\nrecall_simp\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          age  \n    84.0153      -0.3026  \n\n\nWhen we call the name of the fitted model, recall_simp, you can see the estimated regression coefficients \\(\\hat \\beta_0\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\). The line of best-fit is thus given by:1\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{Recall Accuracy}} = 84.02 - 0.31 \\cdot \\text{Age}\n\\]\n\nAlternatively to get these same estimates, we could have used the summary() function:\n\nsummary(recall_simp)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-25.164  -7.761  -2.656   9.593  26.180 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

It estimates the accuracy for a newborn (who wouldn’t be able to complete the task!).\n\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) = age = -0.3\n\nThe estimated difference in recall accuracy for each additional year in age.\n\nEvery 1 additional year in age was associated with a non-significant \\(-0.3\\) percentage point decrease in recall accuracy \\((p = .196)\\). This suggested that age was not significantly associated with recall accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Model Visualisation\n\n\n\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + \n    ylim(0,100) +\n    labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", y = \"Recall Accuracy (%)\", title = \"Association between Recall Accuracy and Age\")\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Association between Recall Accuracy and Age\n\n\n\nThe line that best fits the association between recall accuracy and age (see Figure 6) is only able to predict the average accuracy for a given value of age.\nThis is because there will be a distribution of recall accuracy at each value of age. The line will fit the trend/pattern in the values, but there will be individual-to-individual variability that we must accept around that average pattern.\n\n\n\nMultiple Linear Regression Models\n\n Description & Model Specification\n\n\nMultiple linear regression involves looking at one continuous outcome (i.e., DV), with two or more independent variables (i.e., IVs).\nA multiple linear regression model takes the following form:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{1_i} + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_{2_i} + .... + \\beta_j \\cdot x_{j_i} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\n\nIn R:\nMultiple and simple linear regression follow the same structure within the lm() function - the logic scales up to however many predictor variables we want to include in our model. You simply add (using the + sign) more independent variables. For example, if we wanted to build a multiple linear regression that included three independent variables, we could fit one of the following via the lm() function:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2 + IV3, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV1 + data_name$IV2 + data_name$IV3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interpretation of Coefficients\n\n\nYou’ll hear a lot of different ways that people explain multiple regression coefficients.\nFor the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon\\), the estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\) will often be reported as:\n“the increase in \\(y\\) for a one unit increase in \\(x_1\\) when…”\n\n“holding the effect of \\(x_2\\) constant.”\n“controlling for differences in \\(x_2\\).”\n“partialling out the effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n“holding \\(x_2\\) equal.”\n“accounting for effects of \\(x_2\\).”\n\nFor models with 3+ predictors, just like building the model in R, the logic of the above simply extends.\nFor example “the increase in [outcome] for a one unit increase in [predictor] when…”\n\n“holding [other predictors] constant.”\n\n“accounting for [other predictors].”\n\n“controlling for differences in [other predictors].”\n\n“partialling out the effects of [other predictors].”\n\n“holding [other predictors] equal.”\n\n“accounting for effects of [other predictors].”\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nResearch Question\nIs recall accuracy associated with recall confidence and age?\n\n\n Overview\n\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether recall accuracy was associated with recall confidence and age.

For example, if we wanted to build a linear regression model that included one independent categorical variable which had three levels, we could fit one of the following via the lm() function:\n\n\nOption A\nOption B\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(DV ~ IV1, data = data_name)\n\n\n\n\nmodel_name &lt;- lm(data_name$DV ~ data_name$IV1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Binary Predictors\n\n\nBinary variables have two categories (more commonly referred to as levels), and these levels (e.g., Yes/No, Dog/Cat, Right/Left, Smoker/Non-Smoker) are simply entered in the model as a series of 0s and 1s. Numeric variables that represent categorical data are typically referred to as dummy variables.\nOur coefficients are just the same as before. The intercept is where our predictor equals zero, and the slope is the change in our outcome variable associated with a 1-unit change in our predictor.\nHowever, “zero” for this predictor variable now corresponds to a whole level. This is known as the “reference level”. Accordingly, the 1-unit change in our predictor (the move from “zero” to “one”) corresponds to the difference between the two levels.\nWhen used as predictors in multiple regression models, binary variables behave much the same way. The coefficient will give us the estimated change in \\(y\\) when moving from one level to the other, whilst holding other predictors constant (for more info, see the Multiple Linear Regression Models - Interpretation of Coefficients flashcard).\n\n\n\n\n\n Dummy vs Effects Coding\n\n\nPossible side-constraints on the parameters are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nConstraint\nMeaning of \\(\\beta_0\\)\n\nIn R\n\n\n\nSum to zero (Effects Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu\\)\ncontr.sum\n\n\nReference group (Dummy Coding)\n\\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\mu_1\\)\ncontr.treatment\n\n\n\nDummy Coding\nBy default R uses the reference group constraint - i.e., dummy coding (sometimes called treatment contrast coding). If your factor has \\(g\\) levels, your regression model will have \\(g-1\\) dummy variables (R creates them for you, as we’ve seen in the examples above).\nOne level of the categorical variable is considered as the ‘baseline’, ‘reference level’, or ‘reference group’ - R automatically takes the first level alphabetically as the baseline (e.g., if you had a ‘pet’ variable with levels dog, hamster, and cat, then cat would be taken as the reference level).\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated \\(y\\) when all predictors (i.e., \\(x\\)’s) are zero. Because the reference level is kind of like “0” in our contrast matrix, this is part of the intercept estimate. We get out a coefficient for each subsequent level, which are the estimated differences from each level to the reference group.\nEffects Coding\nEffects coding (sometimes called sum-to-zero coding) is the next most commonly used in psychological research. These are a way of comparing each level to the overall (or grand) mean. This involves a bit of trickery that uses -1s and 1s rather than 0s and 1s, in order to make “0” be mid-way between all the levels - the average of the levels.\nR automatically takes the last level alphabetically as level which is dropped (e.g., if you had a ‘pet’ variable with levels dog, hamster, and cat, then hamster would not be represented).\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated average \\(y\\) when averaged across all levels of the predictor variable. In other words, it is the estimated grand mean of \\(y\\). The coefficients represent the estimated difference for that level from the overall grand mean.\n\nIn R\nIf we want to use effects coding, we can apply:\n\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.sum\"\n\nWe can switch back to the default reference group constraint by applying either of these:\n\n# Option 1\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- NULL\n\n# Option 2\ncontrasts(iris$Species) &lt;- \"contr.treatment\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Coding Variables as Factors\n\n\nWhen we have categorical predictors, it is important that we tell R specifically to code them appropriately as factors.\n\nIn R\nWe can use various functions to convert between different types of data, such as:\n\n\nfactor() / as_factor() - to turn a variable into a factor\n\n\nas.numeric() - to turn a variable into numbers\n\n\nAs a first step, it is a good idea to look at the structure of the dataset you are working with. For the purpose of this example, our dataset is called “tips” (you might recall this from DAPR1):\n\nstr(tips)\n\nspc_tbl_ [157 × 7] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: chr [1:157] \"n\" \"n\" \"y\" \"y\" ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   Bill = col_double(),\n  ..   Tip = col_double(),\n  ..   Credit = col_character(),\n  ..   Guests = col_double(),\n  ..   Day = col_character(),\n  ..   Server = col_character(),\n  ..   PctTip = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n\nFrom the output, we can see that Credit (whether guests paid with a credit card; n/y responses) was coded as a &lt;chr&gt; or character variable. If we wanted to set this as a factor so that R recognises it as a categorical variable, we can use on of the following:\n\n\nas_factor()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\ntips &lt;- tips |&gt; \n  mutate(Credit = as_factor(Credit))\n\n\n\nWe could also use the factor() function, and at the same time label factors appropriately to aid reader interpretation (it may not be immediately clear to some that n represents ‘No’ and y represents ‘Yes’). To do so, we list the all levels of Credit, and provide a new label corresponding to each level:\n\ntips$Credit &lt;- factor(tips$Credit, \n                      levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                      labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n\n\n\n\nUsing either of the above approaches, if we now run str(tips) again, you should see that Credit is now coded as a factor with 2 levels:\n\nstr(tips)\n\ntibble [157 × 7] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: Factor w/ 2 levels \"n\",\"y\": 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Specifying Reference Levels\n\n\nWhen you have a categorical variable coded as a factor, R will default to using alphabetical ordering. We could override this by making it a factor with an ordering to it’s levels (see the use of factor() and levels()). Functions like fct_relevel() might be handy too.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nResearch Question\nDoes sepal length differ by species?\n\n\n Overview\n\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether sepal length differs by species. You have been provided with the in-built dataset, iris, which contains information concerning the sepal length (in cm), sepal width (in cm), petal length (in cm), and petal width (in cm) from three different species of iris (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

In other words, the iris species of setosa had a sepal length \\(0.84~cm\\) shorter than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 + (-0.83733) = 5~cm\\). This difference in length was statistically significant \\((p &lt; .001)\\).\nThe third estimate corresponds to Species2 and was \\(\\hat \\beta_2 = 0.09\\). The difference in mean sepal length between versicolor \\((\\hat \\mu_2)\\) and the grand mean \\((\\hat \\mu_0)\\) was estimated to be \\(0.09~cm\\). In other words, the iris species of versicolor had a sepal length \\(0.09~cm\\) longer than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 + 0.09267 = 5.94~cm\\). This difference in length was not statistically significant \\((p = .121)\\).\nThe estimate for Species3, representing the difference of “virginica” to the grand mean is not shown by summary(). Because of the side-constraint, we know that \\(\\mu_3 = \\beta_0 - (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2)\\). The difference in sepal length between virginica and the grand mean was estimated to be \\(-(-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 0.74466\\). In other words, the virginica iris species had a sepal length \\(0.74~cm\\) longer than average, where its length was estimated to be \\(5.84333 - (-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 6.59~cm\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Model Visualisation\n\n\nThere are a couple of ways that we can visualise our model, eithe rusing the sjPlot or effects packages:\n\n\nsjPlot\neffects\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\n\nplot_model(spec_model,\n           type = \"eff\",\n           terms = \"Species\") +\n    labs(title = \"Sepal Length by Species\",\n       x = \"Species\", \n       y = \"Sepal Length\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(effects)\n\neffect(term = c(\"Species\"), mod = spec_model) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Species, y = fit, col = Species)) +\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Specifying Reference Levels\n\n\nLet’s say we wanted to change the reference level in our “spec_model” above, there are a few different ways that we can do this.\nFirst we should check the current ordering of the levels:\n\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\nWe can then change the reference level to be “versicolor” (using one of the below methods):\n\n\nfct_relevel()\nrelevel()\nfactor()\n\n\n\n\niris &lt;- iris |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Species = fct_relevel(Species, \"versicolor\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- relevel(iris$Species, \"versicolor\")\n\n\n\n\niris$Species &lt;- iris$Species |&gt; \n  factor(., levels = c(\"versicolor\", \"setosa\", \"virginica\"))\n\n\n\n\nAnd then re-run our model:\n\n#fit model\nspec_model2 &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-1.6880 -0.3285 -0.0060  0.3120  1.3120 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

As well as knowing how to extract from R, it is necessary to understand how to compute some of these statistics by hand too.\n\n Model Call\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, model formula highlighted\n\n\n\nThe call section at the very top of the summary() output shows us the formula that was specified in R to fit the regression model.\nIn the above, we can see that recall accuracy is our DV, recall confidence and age were our two IVs, and our dataset was named recalldata.\n\n\n\n\n\n Residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, residuals highlighted\n\n\n\nResiduals are the difference between the observed values and model predicted values of the DV.\nIdeally, for the model to be unbiased, we want our median value (the middle value of the residuals when ordered) to be around 0, as this would show that the errors are random fluctuations around the true line.

Our test is framed in terms of the following hypotheses:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{the model is ineffective, }b_1,...., b_k = 0 \\\\    \n\\]\n\\[\nH_1 : \\text{the model is effective, }b_1,...., b_k  \\neq 0 \\\\  \n\\]\nThe relevant test-statistic is the \\(F\\)-statistic, which uses “Mean Squares” (these are Sums of Squares divided by the relevant degrees of freedom). We then compare that against (you guessed it) an \\(F\\)-distribution! \\(F\\)-distributions vary according to two parameters, which are both degrees of freedom.\nFormula:\n\\[\n\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{\\text{MS}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{MS}_\\text{Residual}} = \\frac{\\text{SS}_\\text{Model}/\\text{df}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{SS}_\\text{Residual}/\\text{df}_\\text{Residual}} \\\\\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& df_{model} = k \\\\\n& df_{residual} = n-k-1 \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k  = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nDescription:\nTo test the significance of an overall model, we can conduct an \\(F\\)-test. The \\(F\\)-test compares your model to a model containing zero predictor variables (i.e., the intercept only model), and tests whether your added predictor variables significantly improved the model.\nIt is called the \\(F\\)-ratio because it is the ratio of the how much of the variation is explained by the model (per parameter) versus how much of the variation is unexplained (per remaining degrees of freedom).\nThe \\(F\\)-test involves testing the statistical significance of the \\(F\\)-ratio.\nQ: What does the \\(F\\)-ratio test?A: The null hypothesis that all regression slopes in a model are zero (i.e., explain no variance in your outcome/DV). The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the slopes is not zero.\nThe \\(F\\)-ratio you see at the bottom of summary(model) is actually a comparison between two models: your model (with some explanatory variables in predicting \\(y\\)) and the null model.\nIn regression, the null model can be thought of as the model in which all explanatory variables have zero regression coefficients. It is also referred to as the intercept-only model, because if all predictor variable coefficients are zero, then we are only estimating \\(y\\) via an intercept (which will be the mean - \\(\\bar y\\)).\nInterpretation:\nAlongside viewing the \\(F\\)-ratio, you can see the results from testing the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients are \\(0\\) (the alternative hypothesis is that at least one coefficient is \\(\\neq 0\\). Under the null hypothesis that all coefficients = 0, the ratio of explained:unexplained variance should be approximately 1)\nIf your model predictors do explain some variance, the \\(F\\)-ratio will be significant, and you would reject the null, as this would suggest that your predictor variables included in your model improved the model fit (in comparison to the intercept only model).\nPoints to note:\n\nThe larger your \\(F\\)-ratio, the better your model\nThe \\(F\\)-ratio will be close to 1 when the null is true (i.e., that all slopes are zero)\n\nHow to calculate \\(F\\)-ratio\n\n\nBy Hand\nUsing R\n\n\n\nSteps:\n\nCalculate model sum of squares\nCalculate residual sum of squares\nCalculate total sum of squares\nCalculate \\(df_{model}\\)\n\nCalculate \\(df_{residual}\\)\n\n\nStep 1, 2, & 3\nFollow steps above in the Sums of Squares flashcard:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{SS}_\\text{Total} = 10  \\\\\n& \\text{SS}_\\text{Residual} = 5.1 \\\\  \n& \\text{SS}_\\text{Model} = 4.9 \\\\  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nStep 4: Calculate \\(df_{model}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&df_{model} = k  \\\\  \n&df_{model} = 1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nStep 5: Calculate \\(df_{residual}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&df_{residual} = n-k-1   \\\\  \n&df_{residual} = 5-1-1  \\\\  \n&df_{residual} = 3  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{\\text{MS}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{MS}_\\text{Residual}} = \\frac{\\text{SS}_\\text{Model}/\\text{df}_\\text{Model}}{\\text{SS}_\\text{Residual}/\\text{df}_\\text{Residual}} \\\\  \n\\\\  \n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{4.9/1}{5.1/3} \\\\  \n\\\\  \n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = \\frac{4.9}{1.7} \\\\  \n\\\\  \n&\\text{F}_{(df_{model},~df_{residual})} = 2.88  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn R\nWe can see the \\(F\\)-statistic and associated \\(p\\)-value at the bottom of the output of summary(&lt;modelname&gt;):\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression output in R, F statistic highlighted\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can extract this information as it is stored in the summary() of the model:\n\n#F-Statistic\nsummary(recall_multi)$fstatistic\n\n   value    numdf    dendf \n12.92426  2.00000 17.00000 \n\n#P-Value\npf(summary(recall_multi)$fstatistic[1], \n   summary(recall_multi)$fstatistic[2], \n   summary(recall_multi)$fstatistic[3], \n   lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n       value \n0.0003866881 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nThe linear model with recall confidence and age explained a significant amount of variance in recall accuracy beyond what we would expect by chance \\(F(2, 17) = 12.92, p &lt; .001\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R-squared and Adjusted R-squared\n\n\nOverview:\n\\(R^2\\) represents the proportion of variance in \\(Y\\) that is explained by the model predictor variables.\nFormula:\nThe \\(R^2\\) coefficient is defined as the proportion of the total variability in the outcome variable which is explained by our model:\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}\n\\]\nThe Adjusted \\(R^2\\) coefficient is defined as:\n\\[\n\\hat R^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}\n\\quad \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nWhen to report Multiple \\(R^2\\) vs. Adjusted \\(R^2\\):\nThe Multiple \\(R^2\\) value should be reported for a simple linear regression model (i.e., one predictor).\nUnlike \\(R^2\\), Adjusted-\\(R^2\\) does not necessarily increase with the addition of more explanatory variables, by the inclusion of a penalty according to the number of explanatory variables in the model.

    "text": "Linear Models\nLinear models rely on numerous underlying assumptions about the data. These assumptions ensure that the association between variables is appropriately captured, and that inferences drawn from the model are accurate and valid. Model diagnostics can help further assess whether these assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, there are numerous techniques that can be employed, such as through data transformations or using robust alternatives, to ensure reliable model interpretations.\n\n Linearity\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression\nIn simple linear regression with only one explanatory variable, we could assess linearity through a simple scatterplot of the outcome variable against the explanatory. This would allow us to check if the errors have a mean of zero. If this assumption was met, the residuals would appear to be randomly scattered around zero.\nThe rationale for this is that, once you remove from the data the linear trend, what’s left over in the residuals should not have any trend, i.e. have a mean of zero.\nMultiple Regression\nIn multiple regression, however, it becomes more necessary to rely on diagnostic plots of the model residuals. This is because we need to know whether the relations are linear between the outcome and each predictor after accounting for the other predictors in the model.\nIn order to assess this, we use partial-residual plots (also known as ‘component-residual plots’). This is a plot with each explanatory variable \\(x_j\\) on the x-axis, and partial residuals on the y-axis***.\nPartial residuals for a predictor \\(x_j\\) are calculated as: \\[\n\\hat \\epsilon + \\hat \\beta_j x_j\n\\]\n\nIn R\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression\nMultiple Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\n#specify model\nrecall_simp &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plot\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, colour = \"blue\") + #fit straight line to data\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, colour = \"red\") + #fit loess line to data\n    labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Recall Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nThe loess line should closely follow the data.\n\n\n\nWe can create these plots for all predictors in the model by using the crPlots() function from the car package:\n\n#specify model\nrecall_mdl &lt;- lm(recall_accuracy ~ recall_confidence + age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plots\ncrPlots(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nYou are looking for the pink line to follow a linear trend line (i.e., follow the blue line). In other words, the loess line should closely follow the linear line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Independence (of errors)\n\n\nThe ‘independence of errors’ assumption is the condition that the errors do not have some underlying relationship which is causing them to influence one another. \nThere are many sources of possible dependence, and often these are issues of study design. For example, we may have groups of observations in our data which we would expect to be related (e.g., multiple trials from the same participant). Our modelling strategy would need to take this into account. \nOne form of dependence is autocorrelation - this is when observations influence those adjacent to them. It is common in data for which time is a variable of interest (e.g, the humidity today is dependent upon the rainfall yesterday).\nTesting for the independence of errors can be pretty difficult, unless you know the potential source of correlation between cases (more on this in DAPR3!).\n\n\n\n\n\n Normality (of errors)\n\n\nThe normality assumption is the condition that the errors \\(\\epsilon\\) are normally distributed in the population.\nWe can visually assess this condition through histograms, density plots, and quantile-quantile plots (QQplots) of our residuals \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\).\n\n\nHistogram\nQQPlot\n\n\n\n\nhist(recall_mdl$residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(recall_mdl, which = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nRemember that departures from a linear trend in QQ plots indicate a lack of normality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Equal Variances (Homoscedasticity)\n\n\nThe equal variances assumption is that the error variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is constant across values of the predictor(s) \\(x_1, \\dots, x_k\\), and across values of the fitted values \\(\\hat y\\). This sometimes gets termed “Constant” vs “Non-constant” variance. This is presented visually in Figure 10 and Figure 11.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Non-constant variance for numeric and categorical X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Constant variance for numeric and categorical X\n\n\n\n\nIn R\nWe can create plots of the Pearson residuals against the predicted values \\(\\hat y\\) and against the predictors \\(x_1\\), … \\(x_k\\) by using the residualPlots() function from the car package. This function also provides the results of a lack-of-fit test for each of these relationships (note when it is the fitted values \\(\\hat y\\) it gets called “Tukey’s test”).\n\nlibrary(car)\nresidualPlots(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Test stat Pr(&gt;|Test stat|)\nrecall_confidence    1.4473           0.1671\nage                 -0.0474           0.9627\nTukey test           0.8769           0.3805\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\nplot(recall_mdl, which = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nIf the assumption is met, you should see a random scatter of \\((x,y)\\) points with constant mean and variance functions i.e., the vertical spread of the residuals should roughly be the same everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Useful Assumption Plots\n\n\n\n\nplot(modelname)\ncheck_model(modelname)\n\n\n\nWe can run plot(mymodel) which will cycle through these plots (asking us to press enter each time to move to the next plot), or we can arrange these plots in a matrix via par(mfrow), for example in a 2 x 2 matrix as shown below (make sure to always reset your graphical parameters! If needed, we could also extract specific plots using, for instance: plot(mymodel, which = 3) for the third plot.\n\nIn R\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n\n\n\nInterpretation Guidance\n\nTop Left: For the Residuals vs Fitted plot, we want the red line to be horizontal at close to zero across the plot. We don’t want the residuals (the points) to be fanning in/out.\n\nTop Right: For the Normal Q-Q plot, we want the residuals (the points) to follow closely to the diagonal line, indicating that they are relatively normally distributed.2\n\nBottom Left: For the Scale-Location plot, we want the red line to be horizontal across the plot. These plots allow us to examine the extent to which the variance of the residuals changes across the fitted values. If it is angled, we are likely to see fanning in/out of the points in the residuals vs fitted plot.\nBottom Right: The Residuals vs Leverage plot indicates points that might be of individual interest as they may be unduly influencing the model. There are funnel-shaped lines on this plot (sometimes out of scope of the plotting window). Ideally, we want our residuals inside the funnel - the further the residual is to the right (the more leverage it has), the closer to the 0 we want it to be.\n\nNote, if we have only categorical predictors in our model, many of these will show vertical lines of points. This doesn’t indicate that anything is wrong, and the same principles described above continue to apply\n\n\n\nThe check_model() function from the performance package is a useful way to check the assumptions of models, as it also returns some useful notes to aid your interpretation. However, it is important to check each assumption individually with plots that are more suitable for a statistics report.\n\nIn R\n\nlibrary(performance)\ncheck_model(recall_mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Multicollinearity\n\n\nFor the linear model with multiple explanatory variables, we need to also think about multicollinearity - this is when two (or more) of the predictors in our regression model are moderately or highly correlated.\nWe can assess multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF), which for a given predictor \\(x_j\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nVIF_j = \\frac{1}{1-R_j^2} \\\\\n\\]\n\nInterpretation Guidance\nSuggested cut-offs for VIF are varied. Some suggest 10, others 5. Define what you will consider an acceptable value prior to calculating it. You could loosely interpret VIF values \\(&gt;5\\) as moderate multicollinearity and values \\(&gt;10\\) as severe multicollinearity.\n\n\nIn R\nThe vif() function from the car package will provide VIF values for each predictor in your model.\n\nvif(INSERT_MODEL_NAME)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Individual Case Diagnostics\n\n\nWe have seen that some specific individual cases in our data can influence our model more than others. We can identify these as:\n\n\nRegression outliers: A large residual \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i\\) - i.e., a big discrepancy between their predicted y-value and their observed y-value.\n\n\nStandardised residuals: For residual \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i\\), divide by the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals. In R, the rstandard() function will give you these\n\nStudentised residuals: For residual \\(\\hat \\epsilon_i\\), divide by the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals excluding case \\(i\\). In R, the rstudent() function will give you these.\n\n\n\nHigh leverage cases: These are cases which have considerable potential to influence the regression model (e.g., cases with an unusual combination of predictor values).\n\n\nHat values: are used to assess leverage. In R, The hatvalues() function will retrieve these.\n\n\n\nHigh influence cases: When a case has high leverage and is an outlier, it will have a large influence on the regression model.\n\n\nCook’s Distance: combines leverage (hatvalues) with outlying-ness to capture influence: \\(D_i = \\text{Outlyingness} \\times \\text{Leverage}\\). Cook’s distance refers to the average distance the \\(\\hat{y}\\) values will move if a given case is removed. In R, the cooks.distance() function will provide these values. Alongside Cook’s Distance, we can examine the extent to which model estimates and predictions are affected when an entire case is dropped from the dataset and the model is refitted.\n\n\n\n\nDFFit: the change in the predicted value at the \\(i^{th}\\) observation with and without the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is included in the regression.\n\n\nDFbeta: the change in a specific coefficient with and without the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is included in the regression. DFbeta represents the difference in the beta coefficients when a case is excluded from the model versus when it’s included. A large DFbeta value would suggest that a case has a substantial impact on the estimated coefficients, and thus a high influence on the model results; a small DFbeta value would suggest that the case has less influence on the estimated coefficients. A commonly used cut-off or threshold to compare \\(|DFBETA|\\) values (absolute values) against is \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) (see Belsley et al., (1980) p. 28 for more info)3.\n\nDFbetas: the change in a specific coefficient divided by the standard error, with and without the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is included in the regression.\n\n\nCOVRATIO: measures the effect of an observation on the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. In simpler terms, it captures an observation’s influence on standard errors. Values which are \\(&gt;1+\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) or \\(&lt;1-\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) are considered as having strong influence.\n\n\nIn R, we can get lots of these measures with the influence.measures() function:\n\n\ninfluence.measures(my_model) will give you out a dataframe of the various measures.\n\nsummary(influence.measures(my_model)) will provide a nice summary of what R deems to be the influential points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next Steps: What to do with Violations of Assumptions / Problematic Case Diagnostic Results\n\n\nThere are lots of different options available, and there is no one right answer. Assuming that we have no issues with model specification (i.e., are not missing variables, have modeled appropriately), then we may want to consider one of the below approaches (note: this is not an exhaustive list!)\n\n\nInvestigate Observations\nSensitivity Analysis\nBootstrapping\nOLS vs WLS Regression\nData Transformations\nUsing Non-Linear Models\nRemoving Observations\n\n\n\nThe first step is to re-examine your data. It is important to be familiar with your dataset, as you need to know what values are typical, normal, and possible. Could it be the case that you have missed some impossible values (e.g., a negative value of a persons height), values outwith the possible range (e.g., a score of 55 on a survey where scores can only range 10-50), values that don’t make any sense (e.g., an age of 200), or maybe there are even typos / data entry errors (e.g., forgetting to put a decimal point, so having a height of 152m instead of 1.52m)!\nIf there is a simple error in the data, it could be that you can fix the typo. If that is not possible (maybe you didn’t collect the data, so are unsure of what the value(s) should/could be), you will need to delete the value (i.e., set as an NA), because you know that it is incorrect.\nWe should aim to never change a legitimate value where possible (and remember that if you have a large dataset, a small number of extreme values will be unlikely to have a strong influence on your results).\nIf there is an extreme, but legitimate value that you have determined is adversely influencing your model (i.e., by examining the assumptions and diagnostics as outlined above), you may want to consider ways to reduce this influence (e.g., winsorizing - which essentially truncates or caps the identified extreme values to a specified percentile, in turn reducing their influence on the model without completely eliminating the observation(s). For example, you could replace values below the 5th percentile with the 5th percentile value, and values above the 95th percentile with the 95th percentile value).\nIf after re-examining your data you cannot identify any atypical, non-normal, or impossible values, you may need to select a different approach as outlined below.\n\n\nThis allows us to assess the sensitivity of our results (i.e., parameter estimates, p-values, confidence intervals) to changes in our modelling approach (i.e., the removal of observations).\nWe can re-fit our model after excluding our identified outliers and potentially influential observations, and compare these results to the original model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Removing Observations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current example involves removing all identified outliers and potentially influential observations at the same time. Ideally, and to ensure a more thorough sensitivity analysis, you would remove each of these observations one at a time, assess the effects on the model by comparing to your original, reassessing the remaining pre-identified observations, and repeating the process if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Model\nModel with Observations Removed\nCompare summary() output\n\n\n\n\n## wellbeing model\nwb_mdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata) \nsummary(wb_mdl1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-15.7611  -3.1308  -0.4213   3.3126  18.8406 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We re-fit the model, excluding these 28 observations (14% of our original sample), and compared these model results (wb_mdl2) to those of our original model (wb_mdl1).\nThere was little difference in the estimates from wb_mdl1 and wb_mdl2, and so we can conclude that after conducting a sensitivity analysis, there were no meaningful differences in our results, and hence our conclusions from our original model hold. Specifically:\n\nThe direction of all model estimates are the same in wb_mdl1 and wb_mdl2 (i.e., all positive)\nThere is no difference in statistical significance, and the p-values were of a similar magnitude (i.e., all &lt; .001)\nThe estimate and confidence intervals for outdoor_time are very similar\nThere are some quantitative differences in the estimate and confidence intervals for social_int. The estimate differs slightly in magnitude by 0.07), but given that this remains positive and significant, we do not need to be too concerned about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bootstrap method is an alternative non-parametric method of constructing a standard error. Instead of having to rely on calculating the standard error with a formula and potentially applying fancy mathematical corrections, bootstrapping involves mimicking the idea of “repeatedly sampling from the population”. It does so by repeatedly resampling with replacement from our original sample.\nWhat this means is that we don’t have to rely on any assumptions about our model residuals, because we actually generate an actual distribution that we can take as an approximation of our sampling distribution, meaning that we can actually look at where 95% of the distribution falls, without having to rely on any summing of squared deviations.\nNote, the bootstrap may provide us with an alternative way of conducting inference, but our model may still be mis-specified. It is also very important to remember that bootstrapping is entirely reliant on utilising our original sample to pretend that it is a population (and mimic sampling from that population). If our original sample is not representative of the population that we’re interested in, bootstrapping doesn’t help us at all.\n\n\nThe method of ordinary least squares regression (OLS: i.e., the type of regression model you have been fitting on the course) assumes that there is constant variance in the errors (homoscedasticity). The method of weighted least squares (WLS) can be used when the ordinary least squares assumption of constant variance in the errors is violated (i.e., you have evidence of heteroscedasticity, like we do in Q3 of this lab).\nIf we have some specific belief that your non-constant variance is due to differences in the variances of the outcome between various groups, then it might be better to use Weighted Least Squares.\nAs an example, imagine we are looking at weight of different dog breeds (Figure 12). The weights of chihuahuas are all quite close together (between 2 to 5kg), but the weight of, for example, spaniels is anywhere from 8 to 25kg - a much bigger variance.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The weights of 49 dogs, of 7 breeds\n\n\n\nRecall that the default way that lm() deals with categorical predictors such as dog breed, is to compare each one to a reference level. In this case, that reference level is “beagle” (first in the alphabet). Looking at Figure 12 above, which comparison do you feel more confident in?\n\n\nA: Beagles (14kg) vs Pugs (9.1kg). A difference of 4.9kg.\n\n\nB: Beagles (14kg) vs Spaniels (19kg). A difference of 5kg.\n\nHopefully, your intuition is that A looks like a clearer difference than B because there’s less overlap between Beagles and Pugs than between Beagles and Spaniels. Our standard linear model, however, assumes the standard errors are identical for each comparison:\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ breed, data = dogdf)\n...\nCoefficients:\n                      Estimate Std.

Accordingly, the Chihuahuas are given higher weights (and so Chihuahua comparisons result in a smaller SE), and Spaniels and Retrievers are given lower weights.\n\nlibrary(nlme)\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/dogweight.RData\"))\ndogmod_wls = gls(weight ~ breed, data = dogdf, \n                 weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | breed))\nsummary(dogmod_wls)\n\n\n\nCoefficients:\n                           Value Std.Error   t-value p-value\n(Intercept)            13.995640  1.044722 13.396516  0.0000\nbreedpug               -4.858097  1.271562 -3.820576  0.0004\nbreedspaniel            5.051696  2.763611  1.827933  0.0747\nbreedchihuahua        -10.077615  1.095964 -9.195207  0.0000\nbreedboxer             20.625429  1.820370 11.330351  0.0000\nbreedgolden retriever  17.922779  2.976253  6.021927  0.0000\nbreedlurcher            5.905261  1.362367  4.334559  0.0001\n\n\nWe can also apply weights that change according to continuous predictors (e.g. observations with a smaller value of \\(x\\) are given more weight than observations with larger values).\n\n\nA data transformation involves the replacement of a variable (e.g., \\(y\\)) by a function of that variable in order to change the shape of a distribution or association (e.g., to help reduce skew). We can transform the outcome variable prior to fitting the model, using something such as log(y) or sqrt(y). This will sometimes allow us to estimate a model for which our assumptions are satisfied.\nSome of the most common (not an exhaustive list) transformations are:\n\n\nLog (log(y)): Often used for reducing right skewness. Note, this transformation cannot be applied to zero or negative values (make sure to check your data!)\n\nSquare root (sqrt(y)): Also often used for reducing right skewness. This transformation can be applied to zero values (but not negative), and is commonly applied to count data\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: A model of a transformed outcome variable can sometimes avoid violations of assumptions that arise when modeling the outcome variable directly. Data from https://uoepsy.github.io/data/trouble1.csv\n\n\n\nThe major downside of this is that we are no longer modelling \\(y\\), but some transformation \\(f(y)\\) (\\(y\\) with some function \\(f\\) applied to it). Interpretation of the coefficients changes accordingly, such that we are no longer talking in terms of changes in y, but changes in \\(f(y)\\). When the transformation function used is non-linear (see the Right-Hand of Figure 14) a change in \\(f(y)\\) is not the same for every \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: The log transformation is non-linear\n\n\n\nFor certain transformations, we can re-express coefficients to be interpretable with respect to \\(y\\) itself. For instance, the model using a log transform \\(ln(y) = b_0 + b_1(x)\\) gives us a coefficient that represents statement A below. We can re-express this by taking the opposite function to logarithm, the exponent, exp(). Similar to how this works in logistic regression, the exponentiated coefficients obtained from exp(coef(model)) are multiplicative, meaning we can say something such as statement B\n\n\n\nA: “a 1 unit change in \\(x\\) is associated with a \\(b\\) unit change in \\(ln(y)\\)”.\n\n\nB: “a 1 unit change in \\(x\\) is associated with \\(e^b\\) percent change in \\(y\\).”\n\n\nFinding the optimal transformation to use can be difficult, but there are methods out there to help you. One such method is the BoxCox transformation, which can be conducted using BoxCox(variable, lambda=\"auto\"), from the forecast package.4\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Models\nHigher Order Terms\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLMs) can appropriately deal with data that do not follow a normal distribution (which is a requirement for traditional linear models). They can accommodate various types of distributions, including the Poisson, binomial, and gamma distributions. This makes them suitable for modelling count data (e.g., number of sunny days Edinburgh has per year - yes, count data can include 0!), binary data (where there are only two possible values e.g., doesn’t wear glasses vs wear glasses, smoker vs non-smoker, i.e., values that are yes/no or 0/1), and other types of non-normal data.\nWe will explore some GLMs later in the course (Semester 2 Block 4), where we will work with logistic regression models.\n\n\nHigher order regression terms refer to the inclusion of polynomial terms of degree higher than one in a regression model. In a linear regression model, the association between the dependent variable (\\(Y\\)) and the independent variable (\\(X\\)) is assumed to be linear, which means the association can be represented by a straight line. However, in many real-world scenarios, associations between variables are not strictly linear, and including higher order regression terms can help capture more complex relationships. Higher order terms that you could incorporate include quadratic, cubic, or higher degree polynomial terms.\nFor example, in a quadratic regression model, the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) can be represented as:\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^2 + \\epsilon\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& Y = \\text{Dependent Variable} \\\\\n& X = \\text{Independent Variable} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs in our models we’ve seen so far, \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), and \\(\\beta_2\\) are the coefficients to be estimated in the above model. What is different from what we’ve seen in DAPR2 is the term \\(\\beta_2 \\cdot X^2\\), and this represents the quadratic term. This allows for a curved as opposed to straight line to represent the association between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\), and hence can allow us to capture more complex relationships. For example, we can model the association between height and age:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Two linear models, one with a quadratic term (right)\n\n\n\nPlease note that these types of models are beyond the scope of the DAPR2 course, but if you want to know more, please do read up on these in your own time.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving outliers and potentially influential observations should be a last resort - not all outliers are inherently ‘bad’ - we do expect natural variation in our population(s) of interest. Outliers can be informative about the topic under investigation, and this is why you need to be very careful about excluding outliers due only to their ‘extremeness’. In doing so, you can distort your results by removing variability - i.e., by forcing the data to be more normal and less variable than it actually is, and reduce statistical power by reducing the size of your sample.\nIf you do decide to remove observations, you will need to document what specific data points you excluded, and provide an explanation as to why these were excluded.\nTo set specific values to NA in our dataset (and save this updated dataset in a new object named mwdata2), we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to set any age values of &lt;20 as NA. In the original dataset mwdata, we had 3 individuals aged 18, and 6 aged 19, so we should end up with 9 NA values in mwdata2 column age:\n\n#specify age column in original dataset, where age is &lt; 20, for values to be set to NA and save to new object named mwdata2 to avoid overwriting original data\nmwdata2 &lt;-  mwdata |&gt; \n    mutate(age = replace(age, age &lt; 20, NA))\n\n#check how many NA values we have - there should be 9 (so 9 TRUEs):\ntable(is.na(mwdata2$age))\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  191     9 \n\n\nIf we wanted to remove a full row from the datset, we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to remove all rows that were highlighted in the above assumption and diagnostic checks as potentially having an adverse influence on our model estimates:\n\n# create new dataset 'mwdata3' without (by specifying -) identified outliers and potentially influential observations\nmwdata3 &lt;- mwdata[-c(16, 25, 50, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 85, 101, 109, 125, 126, 127, 131, 149, 151, 159, 163, 165, 169, 173, 176, 179, 197), ]\n\n# check dimensions - should now have 32 rows less than original dataset 200 - 32 = 168\ndim(mwdata3)\n\n[1] 168   7"

To do so, there are lots of different packages available (see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp).\nOne of the most convenient ways to present results from regression models is to use the tab_model() function from sjPlot.\n\n Creating tables via tab_model\n\n\nWithin tab_model(), there are lots of different ways that you can customise your table. The most common arguments that you should use are dv.labels, pred.labels, and title.\nYou can rename your DV and IV labels by specifying dv.labels and pred.labels. To do so, specify your variable name on the left, and what you would like this to be named in the table on the right. For title, you can simply specify in ““’s what you want your title to be e.g., title = \"This is my title\".\nHere’s an example if I had fitted a model with the following information:\n\nModel name = mdl_test\n\nModel DV = cognitive_score\n\nModel IVs = SES and age\n\n\n\nmdl_test &lt;- lm(cognitive_score ~ SES + age, data = data_name)\n\nI want to change the names of SES and age to be socio-economic status and age - in years respectively. What we need to pay attention to here is the ordering of the IVs - the ordering in our lm() must match that in tab_model(). I also want to name my table Regression Table for Cognitive Scores Model. Here is how we would do this in R:\n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\ntab_model(mdl_test,\n          pred.labels = c('Intercept', 'socio-economic status', 'age - in years'),\n          title = \"Regression Table for Cognitive Scores Model\")\n\nSee here for another short example."

Personality and Individual Differences, 171, 110546. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110546\nIn the current study, participants were invited to an online study investigating the associations among FoMO, socio-demographic factors, and personality. The final sample comprised 3370 people. Participants completed a FOMO scale and a personality inventory. The 10-item FOMO scale measured the extent of experiencing apprehension regarding missing out on interesting events of others on a 5-point scale (1 = “not at all true of me” to 5 = “extremely true of me”), producing a possible range of scores between 10 and 50. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a 45-item personality assessment questionnaire (note that only 43 items were used to match the study above) that uses a five-point response scale (1 = “very inapplicable” to 5 = “very applicable”). The BFI consists of five domains: Neuroticism (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Extraversion (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Openness to Experience (10 items; possible range of scores 10-50), Agreeableness (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), and Conscientiousness (9 items; possible range of scores 9-45). We extended the aforementioned study to include an extra socio-demographic variable - a measure of popularity on social media based on the number of followers. Unlike the original study, we do not have measures of gender, education level, or specific country of residence.\nData Dictionary\nThe data in FOMOdataset.csv contain eight attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=3370\\) hypothetical individuals across the UK, and include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nFOMO\nFoMO Score (as measured by the 10-item FoMO scale)\n\n\nAge\nAge (in years)\n\n\nN\nScore on personality items assessing Neuroticism from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nE\nScore on personality items assessing Extraversion from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nO\nScore on personality items assessing Openness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nA\nScore on personality items assessing Agreeableness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nC\nScore on personality items assessing Conscientiousness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nTotalFollowers\nTotal Number of Instagram Followers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOMO\n      Age\n      N\n      E\n      O\n      A\n      C\n      TotalFollowers\n    \n\n\n28\n38\n26\n30\n32\n27\n38\n98\n\n\n26\n30\n23\n27\n33\n32\n30\n192\n\n\n23\n33\n14\n30\n36\n27\n24\n177\n\n\n18\n44\n26\n21\n37\n28\n34\n119\n\n\n19\n43\n32\n21\n41\n35\n40\n278\n\n\n24\n43\n22\n25\n31\n30\n24\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the FOMO dataset into R, assigning it to an object named fomo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\n\n#Reading in fomo data and storing in object named 'fomo'\nfomo &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/FOMOdataset.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows\nhead(fomo)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n   FOMO   Age     N     E     O     A     C TotalFollowers\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    28    38    26    30    32    27    38             98\n2    26    30    23    27    33    32    30            192\n3    23    33    14    30    36    27    24            177\n4    18    44    26    21    37    28    34            119\n5    19    43    32    21    41    35    40            278\n6    24    43    22    25    31    30    24            184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

You can visualise these by using plot() on the obtained estimated means of the groups\n\nStep 3: Check the order of your levels via levels()\n\n\nStep 4: Define the contrast by specifying the weights following the rules outlined above (as well as paying attention to the ordering of the levels)\n\nStep 5: Test the pre-specified group contrast(s) via contrast()\n\n\nStep 6: Obtain confidence intervals via confint()\n\n\nAfter completing these steps, the last task would be to interpret the results of the contrast analysis in the context of the hypothesis.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nResearch Question\nDoes the sepal length of an iris grown in Western states (i.e., iris setosa) differ from the sepal length of an Iris grown in Eastern states (i.e., iris versicolor and virginica)?\n\n\n Specify Hypotheses\n\n\nBased on the research question, we are asking whether there is a difference between the average sepal length of iris setosa (Western states), and the combined average sepal length of iris versicolor and iris virginica (Eastern state)s. To assess this for the Eastern states, we need to compute the average of the mean sepal lengths of the two species, iris versicolor and iris virginica.\nWith this in mind, we could specify our hypotheses as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\quad H_0 &: \\mu_\\text{Western} = \\mu_\\text{Eastern} \\\\\n    \\\\  \n    \\quad H_0 &: \\mu_\\text{Setosa} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu_\\text{Versicolor} + \\mu_\\text{Virginica}) \\\\\n\\\\  \n\\\\\n    \\quad H_1 &: \\mu_\\text{Western} \\neq \\mu_\\text{Eastern} \\\\\n    \\\\\n    \\quad H_1 &: \\mu_\\text{Setosa} \\neq \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu_\\text{Versicolor} + \\mu_\\text{Virginica}) \\\\\n\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n Conduct Contrast Analysis\n\n\nFollow steps 1-6 outlined above:\n\n# Step 1: Fit and run the model \nspec_model &lt;- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\n\n\n# Step 2: Use`emmeans()`& `plot()`\nlibrary(emmeans)\nseplength_mean &lt;- emmeans(spec_model, ~ Species)\nseplength_mean \n\n Species    emmean     SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n setosa       5.01 0.0728 147     4.86     5.15\n versicolor   5.94 0.0728 147     5.79     6.08\n virginica    6.59 0.0728 147     6.44     6.73\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\nplot(seplength_mean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Step 3: Check levels order via `levels()`\nlevels(iris$Species)\n\n[1] \"setosa\"     \"versicolor\" \"virginica\" \n\n\n\n# Step 4: Define contrast & weights - want to compare Iris setosa to iris versicolor and iris virginica\nseplength_comp &lt;- list(\"Western State Iris - Eastern State Iris\" = c(-1, 1/2, 1/2))\n\n\n# Step 5: run contrast analysis\nseplength_comp_test &lt;- contrast(seplength_mean, method = seplength_comp)\nseplength_comp_test\n\n contrast                                estimate     SE  df t.ratio p.value\n Western State Iris - Eastern State Iris     1.26 0.0892 147  14.086  &lt;.0001\n\n\n\n# Step 6: confidence intervals\nconfint(seplength_comp_test)\n\n contrast                                estimate     SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n Western State Iris - Eastern State Iris     1.26 0.0892 147     1.08     1.43\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\n\n# Bonus Step: Run inferential test and return CIs in one command\nsummary(seplength_comp_test, infer = TRUE)\n\n contrast                                estimate     SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n Western State Iris - Eastern State Iris     1.26 0.0892 147     1.08     1.43\n t.ratio p.value\n  14.086  &lt;.0001\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Results Interpretation\n\n\nImportant to write up our findings in the context of the hypothesis / research question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe performed a test against \\(H_0: \\mu_\\text{Setosa} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu_\\text{Versicolor} + \\mu_\\text{Virginica}) = 0\\).

We are 95% confident that an iris grown in an Eastern state, on average, would be between \\(1.08~cm\\) and \\(1.43~cm\\) longer than those grown in a Western state \\((CI_{95}[1.08, 1.43])\\)."

The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nCredé, M., Roch, S. G., & Kieszczynka, U. M. (2010). Class attendance in college: A meta-analytic review of the relationship of class attendance with grades and student characteristics. Review of Educational Research, 80(2), 272-295. https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654310362998\nThe current study was split into two parts. In the first, researchers were interested in further exploring possible predictors of attendance in university courses. They collected information from 397 students across all years of study (i.e., UG (Y1 - Y4), MSc, and PhD), and recorded their class attendance across the academic year, their level of Conscientiousness (categorized as Low, Moderate, or High), the frequency of which they accessed online course materials (categorized as Rarely, Sometimes, or Often), and the timing of class (categorized as 9AM, 10AM, 11AM, 12PM 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM). In the second, researchers collected data from 200 students, and recorded their class attendance across the academic year and their final course grade.\nData Dictionary: Part 1\nThe data in DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1 contain six attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=397\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\npid\nParticipant ID number\n\n\nAttendance\nTotal attendance (in days)\n\n\nConscientiousness\nConscientiousness (Levels: Low, Moderate, High)\n\n\nTime\nTime of Class (Levels: 9AM, 10AM, 11AM, 12PM, 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM)\n\n\nOnlineAccess\nFrequency of access to online course materials (Levels: Rarely, Sometimes, Often)\n\n\nYear\nYear of Study in University (Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, MsC, PhD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview: Part 1\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npid\n      Attendance\n      Conscientiousness\n      Time\n      OnlineAccess\n      Year\n    \n\n\n1\n9\nHigh\n3PM\nOften\nY3\n\n\n2\n10\nHigh\n2PM\nOften\nY3\n\n\n3\n0\nLow\n10AM\nRarely\nY2\n\n\n4\n8\nLow\n4PM\nOften\nY4\n\n\n5\n6\nHigh\n4PM\nSometimes\nY1\n\n\n6\n6\nHigh\n9AM\nSometimes\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary: Part 2\nThe data in DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2 contain two attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=200\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nMarks\nFinal grade (0-100)\n\n\nAttendance\nTotal attendance (in days)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview: Part 2\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks\n      Attendance\n    \n\n\n25.18480\n10.5\n\n\n25.83144\n11.0\n\n\n25.42314\n11.5\n\n\n26.36523\n12.0\n\n\n27.44285\n12.5\n\n\n29.04029\n13.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1 and DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2 datasets into R, assigning them to objects named data1 and data2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(car)\n\n#Reading in two datasets and store in objects named 'data1' and  'data2'\ndata1 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows of each dataset\nhead(data1)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n    pid Attendance Conscientiousness Time  OnlineAccess Year \n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;\n1     1          9 High              3PM   Often        Y3   \n2     2         10 High              2PM   Often        Y3   \n3     3          0 Low               10AM  Rarely       Y2   \n4     4          8 Low               4PM   Often        Y4   \n5     5          6 High              4PM   Sometimes    Y1   \n6     6          6 High              9AM   Sometimes    Y1   \n\nhead(data2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  Marks Attendance\n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  25.2       10.5\n2  25.8       11  \n3  25.4       11.5\n4  26.4       12  \n5  27.4       12.5\n6  29.0       13  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

    "text": "Assumptions\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nLet’s start by using check_model() for our wb_mdl1 model - we can refer to these plots as a guide as we work through the assumptions questions of the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the useful assumptions plots &gt; check_model() flaschard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots cannot be used in your reports - they are to be used as a guide only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\ncheck_model(wb_mdl1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe check_model() function is a useful way to check the assumptions of models, as it also returns some useful notes to aid your interpretation. There does appear to be evidence that some assumptions may have been violated, but to be sure we need to check each assumption individually with plots that are more suitable for a statistics report.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model satisfies the linearity assumption for wb_mdl1.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nHow you check this assumption depends on the number of predictors in your model:\n\nSingle predictor: Use either residual vs fitted values plot (plot(model, which = 1)), and/or a scatterplot with loess lines\n\nMultiple predictors: Use component-residual plots (also known as partial-residual plots) to check the assumption of linearity\n\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the linearity flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\ncrPlots(wb_mdl1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoother (the pink line) follows quite closely to a linear relationship (the dashed blue line), though there was some deviation. Overall, the evidence suggested that the linearity assumption was met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfy the equal variance (homoscedasticity) assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse residualPlots() to plot residuals against the predictor. Since we are only interested in visually assessing our assumption checks, we can suppress the curvature test output by specifying tests = FALSE.\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the equal variances (homoscedasticity) flashcard.\n\nQuick tip if plotting using plot(model)\nAs the residuals can be positive or negative, we can make it easier to assess equal spread by improving the ‘resolution’ of the points.\nWe can make all residuals positive by discarding the sign (take the absolute value), and then take the square root to make them closer to each other.\nA plot of \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values can be obtained via plot(model, which = 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nWe can visually assess by plotting the Pearson residuals against the fitted values:\n\nresidualPlots(wb_mdl1, tests = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr by plotting the \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values:\n\nplot(wb_mdl1, which = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial residual plots did show non-linear trends between residuals and predictors, hence there is evidence of non-constant variance i.e., heteroscedasticity. Thus, the data did not meet the assumption of equal variance, as the spread of the standardized residuals did not appear to be constant (for the most part) as the fitted values varied.\nIn the second plot, all points are above 0, but the majority of the points are not very close to each other. The line does not appear to be relatively flat, and so this also suggested that the error variance does change across the fitted values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nAssess whether there is autocorrelation in the error terms.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption of independence to have been met (you may have to assume certain aspects of the study design).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the independence (of errors) flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our data were collected from a between-persons study design, we can assume (i.e., based on design, we believe) the errors to be independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfies the normality assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, as well as tips to aid your interpretation, review the normality (of errors) flashcard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nQQ Plot\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = wb_mdl1$residuals)) +\n    geom_histogram() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram indicated that the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) followed close to a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(wb_mdl1, which = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QQplot indicated that the residuals followed close to a normal distribution, as the points followed a linear pattern and there was no substantial skew or departure from normality. There was some evidence of heavier tails, and we may want to examine some observations more closely (e.g., 16, 78, 109)."

A large DFbeta value would suggest that a case has a substantial impact on the estimated coefficients, and thus a high influence on the model results; a small DFbeta value would suggest that the case has less influence on the estimated coefficients.\nA commonly used cut-off or threshold to compare \\(|DFBETA|\\) values (absolute values) against is \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) (see Belsley et al., (1980) p. 28 for more info)2.\nFor our model:\n\\[\n|\\text{DFBETA}_\\text{cutoff}| \\quad = \\quad \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}} \\quad = \\quad  \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{200}}  = 0.141\n\\]\nIn order to extract these in order to arrange in descending order, we need to save our delete-1 measures of influence as a dataframe (via as.data.frame()). Then we can then arrange our DFBETA values in descending order (via arrange(desc(???))). To avoid returning 200 rows of output (i.e., the length of the dataframe), we can ask for the first 15 rows via (head(., 15)):\n\n#save as a dataframe\ninf_mes1 &lt;- as.data.frame(inf_mes$infmat)\n\n#arrange dfbeta values in descending order using the absolute value, and show first 10 rows\n#inf_mes1 |&gt;\n#    arrange(desc(abs(dfb.1_))) |&gt;\n#    head(., 15)\n\nWe can see that we have 11 \\(|DFBETA|\\) values &gt; \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{200}}\\), from observations (or rows) 16, 53, 56, 75, 76, 85, 101, 109, 149, 173, and 179 that we may want to examine further:\n\nwhich(abs(inf_mes1$dfb.1_) &gt; (2/sqrt(200)))\n\n [1]  16  53  56  75  76  85 101 109 149 173 179\n\n\n\n\nValues which are \\(&gt;1+\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) or \\(&lt;1-\\frac{3(k+1)}{n}\\) are considered as having strong influence.\nFor our model, this is: \\[\n1 \\pm \\frac{3(k+1)}{n} \\quad = \\quad 1 \\pm\\frac{3(2+1)}{200} \\quad = \\quad 1\\pm \\frac{9}{200} \\quad = \\quad 1\\pm0.045\n\\]\nThe “infmat” bit of an infl-type object contains the numbers, as we can see from out output above. To use it with ggplot(), we will need to turn it into a dataframe (as.data.frame()), or a tibble (as_tibble()):\n\ninfdata &lt;- inf_mes$infmat |&gt;\n  as_tibble()\n\nNow we can build our plot. It would be useful to add vertical lines at the values \\(\\quad 1\\pm0.045\\). To do so, we can use the geom_vline() function:\n\nggplot(data = infdata, aes(x = cov.r)) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1-0.045), col = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1+0.045), col = \"red\")) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  #remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like a few observations may be having quite a strong influence on the standard errors here. We can check specifically how many observations are potentially having a having strong influence using the cut off \\(1\\pm0.045\\):\n\ntable(infdata$cov.r &lt; 1 - 0.045 | infdata$cov.r &gt; 1 + 0.045)\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  185    15 \n\n\nWe can identify these 15 observations to investigate further:\n\nwhich(infdata$cov.r &lt; 1 - 0.045 | infdata$cov.r &gt; 1 + 0.045)\n\n [1]  16  25  50  58  62  72  73  78  79 109 127 151 159 165 176\n\n\nWe know that observations (or rows) 16, 25, 50, 58, 62, 72, 73, 78, 79, 109, 127, 151, 159, 165, and 176 have \\(\\text{COVRATIO  } 1\\pm0.045\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\nWhat approaches would be appropriate to take given the issues highlighted above with the violations of assumptions and case diagnostic results?\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThere are lots of different options available to us. We may want to consider one of the approaches described in the next steps: what to do with violations of assumptions / problematic case diagnostic results flashcard."

Let’s correct this.\n\n#Code treatment as a factor\ncaffeine &lt;- caffeine |&gt;\n  mutate(treatment = as_factor(treatment))\n\nNext, let’s look at the ‘wpm’ variable. Here we want to check for impossible values.

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ WPM (average number of words typed per minute), and which one of four treatment conditions they were randomly assigned to (Control (Water), Coffee, Mint Tea, or Red Bull).\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among WPM and caffeine treatment conditions. To address the research question of whether WPM differs by caffeine treatment condition, we first need to define the dummy variables for Treatment:\n\\[\n\\text{Treatment}_\\text{Coffee} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Coffee} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad    \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Treatment}_\\text{Red Bull} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Red Bull} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\\\  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad  \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Treatment}_\\text{Mint Tea} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Mint Tea} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad  \n\\]\n\\[\n(\\text{Control (Water) is base level})  \n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following regression model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{WPM} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Treatment}_\\text{Coffee} \\\\    \n+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Treatment}_\\text{Red Bull} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Treatment}_\\text{Mint Tea} + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nThere are no differences in WPM based on caffeine treatment condition.\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nThere are differences in WPM based on caffeine treatment condition."

They hypothesised that sleep deprived individuals would have slower reaction times than non-sleep deprived individuals.\nTo test this, they recruited 60 participants who were matched on a number of demographic variables including age and sex. One member of each pair (e.g., female, aged 18) was placed into a different sleep condition - ‘Sleep Deprived’ (4 hours per night) or ‘Non-Sleep Deprived’ (8 hours per night).\n\n\nA group of researchers were interested in replicating an experiment testing the Stroop Effect.\nThey recruited 50 participants who took part in Task A (word colour and meaning are congruent) and Task B (word colour and meaning are incongruent) where they were asked to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word. The order of presentation was counterbalanced across participants. The researchers hypothesised that participants would take significantly more time (‘response time’ measured in seconds) to complete Task B than Task A.\nYou can test yourself here for fun: Stroop Task\n\n\nA group of researchers wanted to test a hypothesised theory according to which patients with amnesia will have a deficit in explicit memory but not implicit memory. Huntingtons patients, on the other hand, will display the opposite: they will have no deficit in explicit memory, but will have a deficit in implicit memory.\nTo test this, researchers designed a study that included two variables: ‘Diagnosis’ (Amnesic, Huntingtons, Control) and ‘Task’ (Grammar, Classification, Recognition) where participants were randomly assigned to a Task condition. The first two tasks (Grammar and Classification) are known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the Recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 3\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: Matched pairs\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Sleep Condition and Reaction Time\nLevels of variables = Sleep Condition has 2 levels - Sleep Deprived and Non-Sleep Deprived; Reaction Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Sleep Condition - Non-Sleep Deprived because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how the sleep deprived group differed from the non-sleep deprived group.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Within-person: Repeated measures (this is a study design that you will learn more about in DAPR3!)\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Task and Response Time\nLevels of variables = Task has 2 levels - A and B; Response Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Task - A because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how response time in Task B differed from the response time in Task A.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: 3×3 factorial design\nNumber of variables of interest = 2 - Diagnosis and Task\nLevels of variables = Diagnosis has 3 levels - Amnesic, Huntingtons, and Control; Task has 3 levels - Grammar, Classification, and Recognition\nReference Groups = Diagnosis - Control; Task - Recognition. We have chosen Control since the other two groups have some form of cognitive impairment; and the Recognition task since it measures explicit memory whilst the other two task types implicit."

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers had one of three types of music - classical, pop, or silence - played in a restaurant over 18 successive evenings. As well as recording the type of music played during the meal, the researchers also recorded the average spend per person (in £).\nAll participant data was complete (no missing values), with restaurant spending per person within possible ranges. Music type was coded as a factor with three levels (none, pop, and classical).\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among spend per person and background music conditions. To address the research question of whether spend per person differs by background music condition, we can specify our model and coding scheme as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Restaurant Spending} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Effect Level 1} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Effect Level 2} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\[\n\\text{Effect Level 1} = \\begin{cases}\n1  & \\text{if observation is from category 1} \\\\\n0  & \\text{if observation is from category 2} \\\\\n-1 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Effect Level 2} = \\begin{cases}\n0  & \\text{if observation is from category 1} \\\\\n1  & \\text{if observation is from category 2} \\\\\n-1 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSchematically:\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\textbf{Level}           & \\textbf{Effect Level 1} & \\textbf{Effect Level 2} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{None}              & 1   & 0    \\\\\n\\text{Pop}               & 0   & 1    \\\\\n\\text{Classical}         & -1  & -1\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2\\))\nThere are no differences in average spend per person based on background music conditions.\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2\\))\nThere are differences in average spend per person based on background music conditions."

To understand the strength of association among the variables, we will estimate the the correlation coefficients. To address the research question of whether there is an association between people’s scientific knowledge and their attitudes towards science and faith after accounting for their age, we are going to fit the following multiple linear regression model:\n\\[\n\\text{Attitude} = \\beta_0  + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Science Knowledge} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age} + \\epsilon\n\\] Effects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\).\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\): There is no association between people’s scientific knowledge and their attitudes towards science and faith after accounting for their age\n\\(H_1: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\): There is an association between people’s scientific knowledge and their attitudes towards science and faith after accounting for their age"

Results suggested that there was a negative and statistically significant association between attitudes towards science and faith and scientific knowledge after controlling for age \\((\\beta = -0.08, CI_{95}[-0.09, -0.07])\\). Since the 95% CI did not contain zero, we rejected the null hypothesis as there was evidence of an association between peoples’ attitudes towards science and faith and their scientific knowledge after accounting for their age. Specifically, results suggested that for every additional quiz question people got correct, we expected their attitude score to be lower by about 0.08 points, holding age constant. In other words, respondents with greater scientific knowledge tended to be more favorable towards it, regardless of their age."
